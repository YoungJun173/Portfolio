7.4,10,Dekalog (1988),"OCT 31, 2024","For me it is simply breathtaking what a tv series the dekalog is, I know it is classified as a movie but it really is a series consisting of 10 episodes. By far THE GOAT, no questions, THE GREATEST TV SHOW THAT WILL EVER GRACE THIS PLANET, please watch it. Sopranos does not scratch it, not the wire game of thrones or any **** thatyou might think is good like breaking bad, dexter, the boys, band of brothers, mad men. Utter **** when compared to this and utter **** in general except for band of brothers. How is it possible that a tv show with actors you have never heard of can get compared with great films. Usually if you know films you have an understanding that whatever the best tv show oat is, for an example the wire, it probably is worse than catch me if you can, a movie that doesn't come close to top 100. But oh my **** god, Ksistof you **** did it. I AM AN ATHEIST FOR **** SAKE, THIS SERIES IS CENTERED AROUND CHRISTIANITY, the dekalog will changeyour life if you understand it. The way it manages to critique society is unbelivable and I can only compare it to se7en, my favorite movie. But my god, is it a peice of art. If you are into stories or characters go ahead and watch **** fiction that you can binge and be happy and talk to your friends about who killed who, who kissed who or who betrayed who, but if you want to learn something about life and experience an art form that will change your life try to understamd the decalogue and watch THE GOAT of TV the dekalog. Please. When you include fiction and that means films, movies, tv shows and books, dekalog is top 10 for me, a masterpiece.",Daki1105

When it first aired on Polish television in 1989, decades before long-form filmmaking would come to be regarded as the last bastion of auteurism, Krzysztof Kieślowski’s “Dekalog” was one of the most immense undertakings the cinema had ever seen. There had been longer works, and more lavishly financed ones — even when accounting for inflation, “Dekalog” would qualify as a micro-budget project — but the existential girth of Kieślowski’s magnum opus immediately made it feel like a monolith among molehills.",ItsMahdiyarr

7.4,8,Dekalog (1988),"JUN 18, 2019","Commandments rehashed in city lights, they might hold up, might not but Dekalog's quality surely will test against time. Dekalog Krzystof Kieslowski; the co-writer and director, of this phenomenal ten part series, which is often claimed to be as ten hour long film, is a testament in itself, to filmmaking, storytelling and, art that drives all. With the crowd pleasing concept, the writers, Krzystof Kieslowski and Krzystof Piesiewicz, are actually enjoying. That's quite a shock, isn't it? The concepts are established, the theme well introduced, the cinematography almost like some painting, the metaphors spread across like elements and the characters staged with a spectacular choreography. What more is left, they wondered. And fun, is the answer they came up with. Take each of the chapters individually and you'll see for a brief period everyone is let loose in their own rhythm. The cars zooming, couple laughing, mother discovering her son or daughter, friends tearing up, brother spiralling plan and a boy dancing after getting an approval from her crush. What a release it is, speechless, to see such calculated tales feeling no obligation, breaking their rules, for that one smile of the day. Another fine quality and major theme of these films is the physical sequences. He wants you to scratch your brain, Kieslowski, when the physical acts are on the run. What is that urge that he gives birth to, that we feel compelled, almost insisting, on finishing that puzzle. No matter how carefree your attitude is, if someone is being chased or chasing, you would be mesmerized until they leave the frame. The spectators are too hovering around in these films, a particular one that can be seen in every chapter except for the last one, can often be considered as the perspective through which the germ of the idea that these creators had before magnifying these stories on screen. Now, as you can see, Dekalog is timeless not because of the hard work, but because of how much they loved working hard on it, they had fun as much as you had, I'd say that's a balanced world.",amheretojudge

7.4,10,Dekalog (1988),"APR 26, 2018","Krzysztof Kieslowski's ""The Decalogue"" is one of the most powerful cinematic experiences you'll ever have, and probably the best ensemble cast I've ever seen (if you consider them a single film, like I do). I used to think Mike Nichols, Ingmar Bergman and Robert Altman were the supreme actor's directors, but I might consider Kieslowski (1941-1996) my #1 for this project alone. It helps that all the actors are unknown to most of us and not famous Hollywood stars, and that makes the experience even more real, but that wouldn't be much if they couldn't act. I had seen Kieslowski's ""Three Colors"" (which happens to be my all-time favourite trilogy), but I didn't think of him as a particular actor's director because Juliette Binoche or Julie Delpy don't necessarily need a great director to deliver a great performance (I'm not sure about Irène Jacob, though; I haven't seen ""The Double Life of Veronique"", in which she's supposed to be brilliant, and I do like her in ""Red"", but she never impressed me in any movie not directed by Kieslowski). Adrianna Bierdzynska (who looks like a cross between Jennifer Jason Leigh and Hilary Swank) and Olaf Lubaszenko, from segments 4 and 6, respectively, stand out; they're more Oscar-worthy than 90% of the nominees of the past decade; but every member of the cast did a terrific job. Stanley Kubrick described ""The Decalogue"" as the only masterpiece he could name in his lifetime - if that doesn't make you curious to watch this poignant, unique experience, then you're not a film lover. 10 out of 10 in my books.",thelol

9.0,10,Seven Samurai,"MAR 12, 2025","Seven Samurai by Akira Kurosawa is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, and for good reason. Released in 1954, this cinematic masterpiece redefined storytelling and set a benchmark for epic filmmaking. The film follows a group of seven ronin (masterless samurai) who band together to protect a small village from marauding bandits. While the premise may seem straightforward, Kurosawa's execution elevates it to an extraordinary **** film's brilliance lies in its depth and attention to detail. Each of the seven samurai is given a distinct personality and backstory, making them feel like real, multidimensional characters. The villagers, too, are portrayed with nuance, highlighting the complex dynamics between the protectors and the protected. Toshiro Mifune's performance as Kikuchiyo is particularly iconic, blending humor, pathos, and raw energy.Kurosawa's direction is nothing short of revolutionary. His use of dynamic camera movements, innovative editing techniques, and meticulous framing creates a sense of scale and intensity that remains unmatched. The battle sequences are masterfully choreographed, blending chaos and clarity in a way that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The film's pacing, despite its three-and-a-half-hour runtime, is impeccable, allowing moments of action to be balanced with quieter, introspective scenes.Beyond its technical achievements, Seven Samurai is a profound exploration of themes such as honor, sacrifice, and the human condition. It delves into the moral complexities of heroism and the societal structures that shape our lives. The film's influence is immeasurable, inspiring countless works across genres, including the Hollywood remake The Magnificent **** every sense, Seven Samurai is a timeless masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences and filmmakers alike.

9.0,6,Seven Samurai,"OCT 19, 2024",It's easy to understand why Seven Samurai is considered an all time classic but nearly seventy years after its initial release it feels a little too dated to be truly enjoyable.,drlowdon
9.0,8,Seven Samurai,"SEP 25, 2024","A frantic farming community, having overheard local marauders' plans for a post-harvest raid, hires a band of masterless samurai for protection. As strategies are hatched and strongholds fortified, we get to know both villagers and warriors on a close, personal level, uncovering their stories as the seasons gradually change and invasion grows imminent. Legend has it that Kurosawa went far above and beyond in fleshing out this cast, composing detailed family trees and personality profiles for each of the hundred-plus roles to help his actors (even the extras) get under their characters' skin. That level of crazy hyper-focus is indicative of the whole production, which vastly overstepped its budget and shot for nearly four times longer than originally scheduled, but the results can't be denied. Seven Samurai is a justifiably revered classic, a prototype for the modern action movie (not to mention a roadmap for the entire western genre), and a rich portrait of a very specific time and cultural relationship in Japanese history. It may linger too long - there's definitely still some fat on the bone in the two-hundred minute theatrical cut - but the extra quiet time with important characters pays off in the dramatic, joltingly conclusive, final conflict.",drqshadow

9.0,10,Seven Samurai,"MAR 21, 2022","As much as I do love Ran, The Hidden Fortress and Throne of Blood, it was Seven Samurai that I love most of Akira Kurasawa's films. As with all Kurasawa's films, it is incredibly well made with authentic scenery that would give meaning to the term epic and the camera work is truly spectacular. This is especially true in the final battle, with inspired use of moving and multiple camera, precise editing, telephoto lenses and variegated film speeds. As always with Kurasawa, the direction is consistently brilliant. Add to that a stirring score from Fumio Hayasaka and a thoughtful script and you have more reasons why Seven Samurai is so good. The story unfolds slowly, but never felt dull to me and is never hampered by the three-and-a-half-hour running time. Plus Seven Samurai is interesting for being one of the first few to utilise the plot element of recruiting/gathering of heroes into a team to achieve a goal, seen especially with when the audience is first introduced Kambei. The action is spectacular and looks even better with the use of multiple cameras from various angles, and any humanity Seven Samurai has, and it does have a lot, is shown in a poignant way. The cast are excellent, with Takashi Shimura and especially Toshiro Mifune the standouts. Overall, of a resume of one of the greatest directors who ever lived, responsible for many wonderful movies(and I'd say that Seven Samurai and Ran are among the best movies ever made) Seven Samurai stands tall.

9.0,8,Seven Samurai,"SEP 8, 2018","J'avais un vague souvenir du western, un souvenir mitigé à dire vrai voire carrément décevant... mais après l'avoir revu, ça ne fait pas un pli : le remake américain est une horreur de nullité à tous les étages... Une chose est sûre en tout cas, on a avec ces 7 Samouraïs une sorte de quintessence du film japonais par excellence... Bien sûr, on peut tomber sur nombre de films nippons très mauvais mais celui-ci est un heureux mélange d'excentricité et d'émotion, de rigueur et de légèreté à la manière de ce que l'on peut trouver dans les (meilleurs) mangas : parodie et drame se conjuguent ainsi à intervalles réguliers. En témoigne par exemple le personnage complètement siphonné, cinglé et taré interprété par Toshiro Mifune, un acteur d'une énergie inépuisable ! Cet aspect est accentué par les voix japonaises (le film n'a pas été doublé en français apparemment, dommage) : tout le monde semble crier pour un oui ou pour un non et pour nous, Occidentaux peu habitués à de telles vociférations, tout le monde dans ce film nous semble frappadingue... Mais le film sait ménager sa tension, celle des préparatifs et de la stratégie, puis les assauts répétés des bandits ; son scénario est d'une extrême rigueur et rien n'est laissé au hasard ; il sait également décrire avec finesse les comportements et les contradictions de ces paysans, pleutres et courageux à la fois, généreux et mesquins en même temps... En comparaison, la véritable noblesse d'âme de ces 7 samouraïs, leur dévouement et leur engagement n'en apparaissent que plus admirables encore. Le film est certes long et aurait mérité quelques coupes mais on ne s'y ennuie pas, loin de là : c'est bien construit et mis en scène avec une précision étonnante. Et contrairement à ce qu'on faisait en Europe ou aux Etats-Unis, ici au Japon, on hésite pas à filmer la nuit ! et on le fait très bien. Evidemment, on abuse un peu des accélérés (qu'est-ce qu'ils courent vite ces samouraïs !)... chacun son péché mignon, je suppose. Voilà donc un film étonnant, héroïque mais pas mièvre, courageux mais pas vaniteux. Déconcertante et dépaysante, une belle aventure.",Broyax

Shichinin No Samurai The choreography of all the action based sequences are dreadful and well shot, as it keeps it grounded and says a lot about the execution of the feature through it and also the plausible work that went behind the camera for it. Ticking for around 200 minutes, it never feels overstretched, but is elaborated in detail; the difference that the makers are aware of and keeps it separate throughout the course of it. It is rich on technical aspects like sound effects, choreography and production design. Akira Kurosawa; the screenwriter and director, has done an excellent on executing the anticipated vision, and also keeping the tone of the feature alive for such a long period, takes a lot skill and passion towards the project to pull it off. Each individual character in here is allotted a specific track to portray which they do hold on to tightly. There is a lot of concrete material which never gets overstuffed, as the makers take their time whilst holding few tactics to keep the audience on the edge of the seat and engaged through the process. Shichinin No Samurai is an emblem of unity that shines unflinchingly that is at best a classic culmination of all genres and at worst an action packed feature; both the side, it's a win-win.",amheretojudge

9.0,8,Seven Samurai,"JUN 3, 2017","If there were a definitive shortlist of films that could be considered the best one ever made, Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai would most likely be on that list. The story of seven samurai being hired by a village to defend it from bandits is an action adventure film for the ages that has been cited as one of the most influential films of all-time. With its general plotting being used by a variety of westerns after its release and its battle scenes influencing action movies to this day and setting the bar for both, it is easy to see how this influence has been demonstrated over time. Yet, what is unmistakable is how much this film is influenced by the very genre it later influenced. Set in Japan during a civil war in which peasants and farmers are going hungry, the film's general layout is one that had been well-trodden by the American western by the time Seven Samurai came out in 1954. With a cowboy vs the Indians type of setup in its back pocket, Kurosawa's film plays out more like a western than it does a samurai movie, as would later be the case in other Kurosawa films such as Kagemusha and Ran. Though the film references honor and the Samurai code, these men are not absolutely samurai. Instead, they function akin to gunslingers with swords and feels akin to an epic western more than it does a samurai film. With exquisitely choreographed fight scenes between sword-wielding townsfolk and samurai against the invading bandits, the film's epic ambitions are simply found in these attacks. The film is not so much solely about the action, but it is certainly a key reason as to why it is so excellent. As samurai leader Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura) checks off the number of dead bandits and plans for how they will defend the ensuing attack, the film becomes a chess match between the minds of the samurai and the minds of the bandits. Though, in the end, the samurai win by tricking the bandits each time, it is compelling to watch the two do battle in the name of this village. When the two sides meet, the arrows flying, the guns shooting, and the swords slicing are beautifully orchestrated and practically like visual poetry. That said, it is in these action scenes that lies my biggest complaint. Vowing to take the village and burn it down, the bandits do not expect to find the samurai. Yet, even though their numbers dwindle significantly, they keep attacking. While it would be shameful to admit defeat, their only purpose is to take the village and hurt the peasants. There is no greater war they are a part of and they know that there is nothing of value in the village. Yet, they keep attacking in wave-after-wave. It was tough to figure out why exactly they were so insistent on attacking even when it became rather evident that they were severely outmatched by the samurai. However, in saying that, it is hard to find fault with much of the film. Its writing is excellent, its theme of people of opposite causes who hate one another (farmers and samurai) coming together for a common cause is excellent, and its acting is always impeccable. While Kurosawa being able to play with colors is always a treat, watching in black-and-white is still a sight to behold. Not only is the action beautifully put together, but every shot bears a gorgeous poetic nature to it as he soaks in the beauty of the village and the surrounding area. In more contained and close quarter shots, the film is equally as beautiful with the film seemingly never missing a beat visually. In every front, Seven Samurai is an absolutely excellent film in which its ambitions absolutely are met in roaring fashion. However, to nitpick further, it did feel far too long. As previously mentioned, the fact that the bandits just kept coming certainly plays into this as the samurai have to kill 40 bandits for the film to end. Had the bandits rightfully backed off, the film's length would have been far more digestible. As it stands, many of the battle scenes are rather repetitive and just rehashes of the one prior with slightly different strategies at play. Again, a nitpick, but an issue nonetheless. An epic and greatly influential film, Seven Samurai lives up to its billing as one of the best films ever made, even if I had some rather small complaints that hold it back in my eyes. Its beauty is unmistakable, however, with its lyrical nature becoming quite intoxicating and its human relations being raw, powerful, and a perfect encapsulation of the one thing that unites us all: death.",Spangle

Or modern anything really. You also have to get over the very Japanese acting. Watching some anime first may actually help there! I did reduce the score from the perfect 10 because I feel it would be dishonest to call it ""perfect"" when it so clearly is not, given many decades of hindsight. But it is still a very moving movie well deserving of your time.

9.0,10,Seven Samurai,"APR 30, 2016","Let me ask you a quick question: When you're watching a movie, what's the first thing you notice or look for? Acting? Lighting? Color? Shots? Shapes? All of these are just naming a few great elements of what makes a movie so special, as there's plenty more out there that I probably left out, but those are mostly the key ones that some film makers choice when making a movie. But when I watch a movie, the first thing I look for is hidden quality, storytelling by the characters movements, acting, lighting, and the use of silence to add emotion to a scene. And yes, this movie absolutely has all of those things I love in movies and much more. I think I died and went to movie heaven. Sometimes when I talk about a beloved movie that many film makers and critics out there consider a ""masterpiece"", I think it's very important for me to talk about the actual film making and what makes it so great, as this gives a better thought of what I see when I watched the movie. I mean, it's much better than saying what you like or didn't about a film without talking about the film making itself. Oh and this also my first Akira Kurosawa movie I've watched and reviewed, so there's that. I've heard nothing but amazing things about Kurosawa movies and how every famous director has put him up there as the best director that has ever lived, and I totally understand why, because Akira Kurosawa is one of the most stylish, influential, and one of the most tremendous film maker that has ever lived. From start till finish, I was completely in awed from what I was watching and it's still fresh in my mind as I'm writing this. For Kurosawa's film career, he has made over 30 films and a few TV movies, but ""Seven Samurai"" seems to be the one movie that everyone knows about (even if there haven't seen it). And I understand why, as everything with the camera work, editing transitions, and the use of mother nature as an emotional trigger for the audience, is everything that an audience can emotional relate to and draw their eye to. Because the choices of weather used in scenes that basically sums up what kind of mood a character or a scene itself is feeling. Wind, sunshine, and rain, really do add a lot to the scene, as you can tell what you're suppose to be feeling. Akira Kurosawa was quite famous for how he wanted to get the weather perfect in his scenes. Over a course of a year, he shot this movie for 148 days and it was often him waiting for the weather for the next scene. And that's not all, Kurosawa told his actors to chose a gesture for their character and stick with it. That way, we know exactly what kind person their are and how they're feeling. It's bold film making like this is what made Akira Kurosawa a massive influence to cinema today. Another thing I loved about this movie is the characters, as I actually did care for them and their struggle. I sometimes find it very hard to have a full emotional attachment to characters in movies, but here, it amazes me how I know so much from the characters just by their movements that really dose say a lot without them saying anything. All the praise has to go to the actors for this, as it was them who had to deliver and they absolutely do. I'm unaware with all of these actors, but then again, I don't watch that much black and white Japans movies these days. All of the cast were all superb in their roles and most have been a very different cult challenge to pull off, because it's not easy as it looks, but all of them nailed it. The camera work in this movie is so impressive, so unique, and freaking glorious. The way the camera moves tells a story of itself that doesn't require any character to spill out the story or what's going on. I could show any scenes from this movie to someone who hasn't see the movie themselves and even they will have a full grasp on whats going or how someone is feeling without knowing nothing about the movie itself. That's how brilliant this movie. Overall: Seven Samurai is a epic masterpiece with flawless imagery and a unique style of violence and battles.

9.0,10,Seven Samurai,"FEB 27, 2015",Akira Kurosawa was the Master of Cinema. This is one of the greatest movies of all time. Not just has this movie influenced some of the greatest westerns but also his reach in general has been seen and felt without you ever even knowing it. The story **** of people who did not know each other but banded together to save a village is a story of sacrifice that just never gets old. His story telling techniques and characters are well fleshed out. This is a must see for anyone who loves Cinema in general to see how it has influenced all the movies since it's release. Directly this was remade into The Magnificent Seven. although that was an awesome Western and a Classic the Original Seven Samurai is just far and above. The Criterion Collection Bluray makes it even more gorgeous and gives so much more than just the movie and well worth the price.,UnKn0wN_DiSeAsE

This is a classic example of truly deep cinema that will never be able to be recreated. Simply breathtaking from the performances to the sets, everything is outstanding. Kurosawa was famous for being a perfectionist when it came to his sets and it shines through here. The villages look incredible and everything looks perfect, including the costumes. The action is without par and extremely realistic, which adds to the sense of realism and drama unfolding before us. A perfect film.",Jiraia
9.0,10,Seven Samurai,"FEB 5, 2013",This is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. The dynamic between the characters is beautifully done. I still can't get around the fact that Kurosawa wrote each of the characters background just for this movie; now that's commitment. The story seems straightforward on the surface but it's the driving point of each characters development that is put into focus. Each performance is nuanced and even Mifune's seemingly goofy performance lies a history that drives to do what he does. One of my favorite movies and should not be missed.,Weaselboyst
9.0,7,Seven Samurai,"JAN 26, 2013","This was my first Kurosawa film and I was not disappointed. I am not one to talk about film length very often, I think a film should be however long it takes the director to tell the story. I will admit however when I fired up Seven Samurai on Hulu and 3:46 appeared at the bottom I was very worried. Making it through a 1954 foreign language action film of this length did not seem like something i was ready for. Kurosawa however doesn't waste a scene in this film even if many scenes are a little more on the nose than I would prefer. My problems with the film are the same problems that I have with a lot of classic films. All of our characters are one dimensional which makes them fairly predictable. We know what purpose they will serve in the plot almost from the moment we meet them, to the point where we can predict which characters are probable to live and which will likely die. I also have an issue with the portrayal of the peasants in this film. The peasants are the center of our story and are treated with disdain by all of the characters around them. While this is understandable in the context of the film, I felt throughout that Kurosawa treated them the same way. Every peasant, except possibly one, in this film is treated like a fearful moron. Often they are seen running around aimlessly babbling incoherently to each other. When they do engage our heroes in conversation they have nothing to add to the process that is transpiring. There is no better evidence of this than in one of our seven heroes. As soon as we meet this character we know he will be a part of our group, yet he is always treated like a punch line. He is treated like that by the other characters because he is written like that by our story teller. In one of the plot twists midway through the film it is revealed he is a peasant. This comes as no surprise because of the seven samurai he is the most peasant like. Each character must fit into a stereotype. What engaged me in this film is the glimpse into the culture as well as the cinematography. For a movie made in 1954 it looks amazing. We are transported into this world through the landscapes, through the poverty that is portrayed visually, and through the way the characters interact with one another. Kurosawa also does a fantastic job with the action in this film. In a movie that the plot revolves entirely around a village protecting itself it would have been easy to just piece action scene after action scene together. Kurosawa never does this, the action is always handled in a very intelligent way. Giving us just what we need to get the next part of the story. Overall I enjoyed this film quite a bit, and am looking forward to seeing more of Kurosawa's work. I am reluctant to give classic films like this star ratings, as they rarely engage me the way they need to emotionally to warrant consideration in my favorites, or multiple viewings. This film reminds me of Citizen Kane in that I respect it more than I love it, and will probably reference it more than I will watch it.",seancriswell

TDKR is around 7.8-8.2 while SEVEN SAMURAI is surely wavering around 8.2-8.5).

Except for the Pleasure Island sequence, the postcard-idyllic kitsch factor was too much for me; none of the songs were uplifting, and both Geppetto and the cricket were quite annoying. From today's perspective, the animation technique in the second Disney film is exciting; you can clearly see how the animation was done with great attention to detail, but it hadn't yet reached the routine perfection that would soon follow. The cat is very cute. I never need to see it again, but it was nice to watch it again.",JeBjBo

Tres años después de su primera película, debo decir que la historia y el cuento original ayudan bastante a que esta película tenga un tono más serio, e incluso en muchos momentos hasta un tanto tétrico, lo cual me gusta mucho. Se ve que existía cierta libertad creativa, cosa que en la actualidad se ha perdido. Hay chistes o escenas que de niño o jovencito no entiendes en su totalidad, y ver esta película con una edad madura, puedes disfrutar de detalles que suman totalmente. Lo único es que me hubiera gustado que al final, quien rogara y pidiera fuera Pinocho por su padre, para que de esa forma se mostrara una mayor madurez del personaje. Aun así, es un buen final, y una excelente película.",BigP4pa

8.1,8,Pinocchio,"SEP 24, 2024","Disney's second big-time animated feature looks markedly better than Snow White, no small feat, but otherwise falls a little short of meeting that first film's high standard. ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" notwithstanding, the songs aren't as memorable, the foil isn't as well-defined and the plot is less focused. Which isn't to trash the whole effort - it's still an incredibly charming, timeless creative success - but I'd consider it a slight letdown in a few crucial areas. Pinocchio himself is as inherently innocent as they come. That's an essential part of his character, but it leads him into a lot of easily-avoided trouble. Somewhat frustrating to watch, as he fails to learn from countless mistakes and warnings, but it could be argued that such is childhood in a nutshell. The mythical ""get out of jail free"" card he carries, an extremely forgiving (and slightly unnerving) fairy, bails him out of nearly every jam anyway, so the greater dangers ultimately feel rather toothless. The story skips around a lot, bouncing from a jolly family home to a rowdy stage show, a risqué island of naughty indulgence (and puzzling transformation) to the cramped confines of a whale's belly. That gives the visual crew ample opportunity to flex, but also feels excessive and disjointed. More like a series of one-off episodes than a single, cohesive story, at least until the third act. There's also a team of anthropomorphic cats carousing about, causing trouble, which is odd given the otherwise all-human population, and undercuts the fundamental strangeness of a wooden puppet come to life. Disney's wand still has plenty of magic - Pinocchio is a constant visual delight - but in this case, it would benefit from a longer attention span.",drqshadow
8.1,7,Pinocchio,"AUG 24, 2024","Logically, the movie is very confusing. The cat doesn't talk, but the fox does and dresses like a man, yet it's considered a miracle when Pinocchio does these things. There’s no character development, and everything happens suddenly. The film is too dark and very scary for children. The villain characters appear pathetic. My biggest problem with the movie is the Pinocchio school-going scenario and the scenes inside the whale.Technically, the movie is very good, the animation of the Blue Fairy, the underwater scenes and Pinocchio itself are excellent. The music and songs are good, especially the title song 'When You Wish Upon A Star,' which is a classic. Jiminy doesn’t look like a cricket and is horny, but the dialogues are good and funny. Every time Jiminy goes outside with Pinocchio, who keeps getting lost, it irritates me.",suneshp

It's an 8/10, a must-watch, and while some small plots and characters don't make sense(It's an animation, it doesn't really matter besides what they represent), or aren't explained well, it still drags you into a world full of delight and sometimes a mystery.",infraRecon

8.1,10,Pinocchio,"NOV 2, 2020","Last night I watched Pinocchio, Disney's second feature-length film and in my opinion one of the studio's best features. Based on the 19th century book by Carlo Collodi, but not half as unpleasant, Pinocchio combines winning animation with great humor and excitement. There are songs, but they're never like the huge production numbers that last four minutes and feature the voice of some up-and-coming princess of pop (who'll be gone in a year) that the studio later adopted with the applicable exception of When you Wish Upon a Star. My favorite song is ""Little Wooden Head"" which is featured in the beginning and is a truly wonderful scene as Gepetto and Figaro play happily with the new puppet. The movie takes a sadistic, cruel, heartless little wooden boy (Collodi's character) and turns him into an interesting, 3-dimensional kid with a good heart but who is weak-willed and doesn't always listen to reason. The animation makes brilliant use of the multiplane camera, featuring a sprawling opening sequence in which the viewer practically sees the entire village at night. The characters are colorful and fun (I especially love Honest John Foulfellow and his sidekick Gideon) and the story has never a dull moment. This film is a reminder of the sort of efforts Disney put int o their films; the man himself had a great storytelling passion that was lost in later works (Alice in Wonderland, 101 Dalmatians). Pinocchio was never as famous as some of the others, and this is unfortunate because it is his masterpiece.",meydianarizki21

8.1,6,Pinocchio,"MAY 25, 2020","Jiminy Cricket explains that he is going to tell a story of a wish coming true. His story begins in the Italian workshop of a woodworker named Geppetto. Jiminy watches as Geppetto finishes work on a wooden marionette whom he names Pinocchio. Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes a wish on a star that Pinocchio will be a real boy. During the night, a Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he still remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy, and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience. Geppetto discovers that his wish has come true, and is filled with joy. However, on his way to school, Pinocchio is led astray by Honest John the Fox and his companion, Gideon the Cat, who convinces him to join Stromboli's puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him in a birdcage. Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio and is unable to free him. The Blue Fairy appears and asks Pinocchio why he was not at school. Jiminy urges Pinocchio to tell the truth, but instead, he starts telling lies, which causes his nose to grow longer and longer. Pinocchio vows to be good from now on, and the Blue Fairy returns his nose to its original form and sets him free while warning him that this will be the last time she can help him. Meanwhile, across town, Honest John and Gideon meet a coachman who promises to pay them money if they can find naughty little boys for him to take to Pleasure Island. Encountering Pinocchio on his way home, they convince him that he needs to take a vacation there. On the way to Pleasure Island, he befriends Lampwick, a delinquent boy. Without rules or authority to enforce their activity, Pinocchio and the other boys soon engage in smoking, gambling, vandalism, and getting drunk, much to Jiminy's dismay. Later, while trying to get home, Jiminy discovers that the island hides a horrible curse: the boys brought to Pleasure Island transform into donkeys for their misbehavior and are sold to slave labor in the salt mine and circus. Jiminy runs back to warn Pinocchio, only to discover that Lampwick has transformed into a donkey; Pinocchio manages to escape the island, only with donkey ears and a tail. Upon returning home, Pinocchio and Jiminy find the workshop vacant. They soon get a letter from the blue fairy as a dove, stating that Geppetto had ventured out to sea to save Pinocchio from Pleasure Island, but was swallowed by a giant whale named Monstro, and is now living in his belly. Determined to rescue his father, Pinocchio jumps into the sea accompanied by Jiminy. Pinocchio is soon swallowed by Monstro as well, where he is reunited with Geppetto. Pinocchio devises a scheme to make Monstro sneeze, giving them a chance to escape. The scheme works, but the enraged whale chases them and smashes their raft. Pinocchio pulls Geppetto to safety in a cave before Monstro crashes into it. Geppetto, Figaro, Cleo, and Jiminy are washed up safely on a beach, but Pinocchio is shown apparently lifeless in a rockpool. Back home, an inconsolable Geppetto weeps over Pinocchio as Jiminy Cricket and the pets also mourn the loss. The Blue Fairy, however, decides that Pinocchio has proven himself brave, truthful, and selfless. To reward him, the Blue Fairy resurrects Pinocchio, reversing the Pleasure Island curse and turning him into a real boy. Pinocchio awakens and reveals that he is alive and a real human boy, much to everyone's joy. As everyone celebrates, Jiminy steps outside to thank the Fairy and is rewarded with a solid gold badge that certifies him as an official conscience.",greedybadidea

Y lo entiendo, es decir, querían hacer una representación de la aristocracia francesa, que incluso en momentos tan decisivos como el inicio de una guerra, les importaba tan poco y lo único en lo que radicaban sus pensamientos era en seguir comportándose como lo haría una élite desconectada de la realidad. El problema es que, aun así, y aunque la representación podría ser bastante crítica y fiel, para mí fue terriblemente tedioso ver esta película. Entiendo que algunas personas, en un imaginario, sigan creyendo que la vida de estas personas, entonces y en la actualidad, es el pináculo al que todas las personas quieren alcanzar, pero creo que alguien medianamente crítico sabe que no es cierto, y que más bien lo ideal sería ignorar y dejar de vanagloriar vidas tan vacías, por lo que, para mí, es una pésima película.",BigP4pa

6.8,7,Intolerance,"OCT 28, 2024","¡ LA PRIMERA GRAN PELÍCULA DE LA HISTORIA ! Quiero dividir esta reseña en dos partes. La primera es el apartado técnico, que es sobresaliente, rozando la excelencia. Al ser cuatro historias, hay muchos más escenarios, y todos y cada uno de ellos presentan una calidad de detalle casi enfermizo; incluso ahora hay escenas que me dejan con la boca abierta. Por supuesto, no está exenta de errores pequeños, casi imperceptibles, pero me gustaría nombrarlos. En los primeros planos, se usa un tipo de desenfoque que hace que se pierda calidad en algunas escenas, ya que al aplicarlo es necesaria una mayor iluminación, algo que se les pasa por alto en ciertas tomas. No es nada problemático, ni tampoco arruina las escenas.Como segundo apartado está la narrativa, y aquí tengo varias opiniones encontradas. Al ser cuatro historias, temía que no se profundizara en ninguna y que la narrativa, al final, se diluyera, y efectivamente así fue. El problema radica principalmente en dos aspectos. Primero, las historias no son lineales, sino que van intercalando escenas, lo que provoca que, cuando empiezas a engancharte con la historia, cambian, y ese efecto de inmersión se desvanece. El segundo punto es que, al ser tantas historias, algunas tienen más protagonismo que otras, lo que me hace preguntarme si no habría sido mejor utilizar tres o dos historias y desarrollarlas **** estas razones, no creo que sea la mejor película de la historia, como afirma cierto sector de la crítica. Creo que se dejaron apantallar con el gran despliegue técnico de la película, lo cual es bastante razonable. Sin embargo, si profundizas y no te quedas en la superficie, empiezas a notar las costuras. Da la impresión de que el autor de la película lo único que quería era demostrar que puede hacerla y que tiene los recursos para ello. La frase “mientras más grande, mejor” le queda perfecta, pues no parece haberse molestado demasiado en pensar si era necesario invertir tantos recursos solo para probar que **** no se malinterpreten mis palabras: para mí —y lo digo de forma categórica—, es la primera gran película de su tipo. Sin embargo, tengo la impresión de que podría haber sido aún mejor. Bastante recomendable.",BigP4pa

7.1,8,Moonlight,"MAR 18, 2022","Wanted to see as many 2016 films as possible, especially those that won or were nominated for the big awards. Took me a while to see 'Moonlight', with the controversy it garnered when it was announced for the Best Picture Oscar and the amount of hate it's got here part of me was wary. Finally getting round to seeing 'Moonlight', it turned out that it was more than well worth the while and that the wariness was not needed. 'Moonlight' is not a perfect film and may not have been my personal pick for the Best Picture award (for me that was 'La La Land' though that is not a popular opinion it seems). Truly admired what it set out to do and found it a brave and powerful film, despite what the detractors say there is far more to 'Moonlight's' appeal than politics, sexuality and race (clearly trying to find conspiracy theories and reasons for why a film they dislike is loved by others, without taking into account that the film simply just connected to and resonated with those who liked it). 'Moonlight' does end on an anti-climactic note, some of the last act is a bit rushed. A longer length would have helped as a result, it also would have helped make a couple of events in the first act a little clearer and not so choppy. It may not say much new, despite the ground-breaking concept on paper with the exploration of lives rarely seen on film, and doesn't always have subtlety. Then again it is tackling far from subtle themes and a heavy subject, so that sort of was going to be inevitable. However, 'Moonlight' is an exceptionally well made film. The cinematography and editing are some of the most eye-pleasing and best of that year, and can't find anything to fault the expertly handled direction. The music is cleverly mixed and has haunting power and fluidity. Regarding the writing, it is not perfect, at times as said a little heavy-handed and vague in parts, but it is thought-provoking and handles very ambitious, relevant, important themes with power, truth and (mostly) delicacy. The story makes the most of the three act structure, it's handled simply but not simplistically and also handled cleverly and with passion, honesty and intelligence. Found myself relating quite a lot to and being moved significantly by the story and found the film handled a heavy and sensitive subject matter with a lot of relevance and importance today more than admirably. Can't fault the acting, doing wonders with compellingly real characters and strongly defined character relationships (especially the central one). Much has been made of Maharshala Ali and Naomie Harris and deservedly with two of the best performances that year, Ali especially is extraordinary. It is easy though to overlook Alex R. Hibbert, Trevante Rhodes and Ashton Sanders and one shouldn't, as they are just as worthy (particularly Sanders). Overall, didn't completely blow me away but very well done and with a lot to admire. 8/10 Bethany Cox",kyle20ellis

7.1,9,Moonlight,"SEP 4, 2021","The best way to describe Moonlight is a painting that is so realistic that it looks like a picture. The film tackles issues people may not have even crossed that average viewer's mind and does it brilliantly. It does not over dramatize, or over romanticize any moment. Everything is exactly how it should be. It provides insight into all types of challenges mixed into one perspective. Camera work also makes the movie feel first person. Scenes where the camera is half submerged into the ocean invokes nostalgia of when you were young and could barely keep your head above water. Everytime the film leaps in time to a different point in Chiron’s life, the viewer has a lot of catching up to do. Chiron changes on the surface in a substantial manner. However, eventually, you realize that each and every Chiron is the same on the inside. The message of self identity in this film is hammered home. I go back to my point of the film being a realistic painting. Many directors aim for twists on their films to make it feel authentic to themselves, similar to how Picasso may skew his paintings to make it identifiable as “a Picasso” . Barry Jenkins' approach was to make this film authentic to the viewer. He focused on the truth of the matter at hand. He found success in making the matter relatable to viewers who may have never thought to relate to Chiron.",ben1322

De alguna manera, sus bromas son esperadas, y lo que antes era una gran carcajada ahora es solo una sonrisa.

8.7,8,City Lights,"SEP 21, 2024","Charlie Chaplin falls for a blind flower girl and lives the high life with a lush, amnesiac fatcat, sampling and exploiting various urban lifestyles along the way. Playful and carefree, like all the classic auteur's best pantomimes, this is more of a loosely-related collection of skits than an all-enveloping story. The sidetracks are all great, of course - The Tramp as a late replacement in the boxing ring, all manner of drunken hijinx in a ritzy club on New Year's Eve, slapstick encounters with a newly-unveiled statue before an outraged audience - but it doesn't get quite as deep under the skin as Chaplin's masterpieces. That he doesn't share a wealth of chemistry with his leading lady, Virginia Cherrill (who endured a contentious relationship with the star during production), isn't so much to blame as their too-swift courtship and her disappearance during the second act. We never really get a chance to love them as a couple, though their sweet parting shot serves as proof that such spoils were within reach.

8.7,10,City Lights,"MAR 27, 2022","As much as I loved The Kid, The Gold Rush, Modern Times and The Great Dictator, City Lights is the film I consider Charlie Chaplin's masterpiece. And there are several reasons why this is so for me. I love how City Lights is filmed, once again the cinematography is stunning as are the costumes and sets. The music is also a delight(though my favourite soundtrack in a Chaplin movie is the one for Modern Times) with plenty of themes that stuck in my head, while the sound effects are wonderfully incorporated and the subtitles easy to understand. The comedy is brilliantly done, the scene in the boxing ring is not only one of my favourite scenes in a Chaplin movie(along with the final sequence and the dance of the bread rolls of The Gold Rush, the final scene of The Kid and the speech from The Great Dictator) but ever in a comedy, while there is a very touching love story between the Tramp and the little blind girl(played touchingly by Virginia Cherrill) he falls in love with. And I also found the close-up climax achingly poignant because of its beauty and ambiguity. Chaplin is superb, his pantomime skills and physical humour are extremely well judged and he is acts beautifully with Cherrill. Overall, yet another Chaplin masterpiece, yet for me this is the best of them all. 10/10 Bethany Cox",kyle20ellis
8.7,10,City Lights,"OCT 25, 2021","Watching this gem reminds you that Chaplin's true greatness lie not in his pitch perfect humor, but in his humanity. Here, he delivers a heartfelt story that at no point feels manipulative or contrived, even viewing it from a modern lens drenched in emotional overload. ""City Lights"" is Chaplin at his most human. He transcended the medium with silence (even when sound was available) and showed the world what cinema is capable of being, with moving pictures that move every fiber of your soul.",FilmLove
8.7,10,City Lights,"AUG 21, 2021","As I was watching Charlie Chaplin's 'City Lights', I was watching the ups and downs of life's simplicities unfold before my eyes. The film has a sweet, funny, and charming personality that is all wrapped up with a level of class and sophistication- handled masterfully by Chaplin's passion to contributing a large chunk of the film himself. 'City Lights' is unlike any other films that have come after it because it truly is rooted in delivering a story that is fueled on basic human wants and emotions. The only thing I wish was better was its pacing, and no, I don't mean that because it is a silent film that needs to use cards for dialogue, it's just that some of its scenes drag. However, all is more than forgiven because this film contains quite possibly the best concluding payoff ever put onto film. I truly mean that, the ending to this film perfectly captures raw expressions that are enough to move all who have watched this adorably funny, yet poignant, adventure. Bravo!",Gamzguy17
8.7,10,City Lights,"JUL 3, 2020","Started with Modern Times and found the comic genius of Charlie Chaplin. I've seen his movies before but they were mostly a blur. Now that I have revisited them I found a newfound appreciation for this era (somewhat). From The Kid to The Gold Rush, all his movies have laughs and heart, something I never thought I'd find in comedies. City Lights takes the cake for me sharing a slice of it with Modern Times. The Tramp in some scenes might come off as a booze-drinking, cigar-chomping klutz but this is only because of his selflessness that leads him into these circumstances putting him in one comedic situation to another. What I love about this movie is the relationship he develops with a blind flower girl which blossoms (pun intended) into something pure and innocent. This contrasts his relationship with the millionaire who takes him galavanting, often leading into trouble. Don't let the lack of color and spoken dialogue fool you, this movie packs a lot of heartfelt moments, further cementing Charlie Chaplin's place in cinema history. Must watch.",Weaselboyst

8.7,8,City Lights,"MAY 21, 2020","Real Rating: 83.5/100 This is my 3rd favourite film of Chaplin's. Modern Times and the Great Dictator, rank higher for me personally. Though to the man himself, this is his favourite film and Welles, Kubrick, Tarkovsky and Woody Allen agree. It is strange though that Chaplin's 3 greatest works came after he was deemed obsolete, but being the artistic Luddite, he was. He pushed forward and did not allow modern technology to steal his craftsmanship. In a way, you must applaud that, but at the same time from a critical analysis standpoint, you must also detract marks for it. For is it genius? Or a has-been doing their best to cling on to a world that has moved beyond them? BE: With a Chaplin film you have to ask yourself can you really comment on the directing. Given that he does a large percentage of the workload himself, it would be like applauding Michelangelo's overseeing of the Sistine Chapel rather than the painting itself. The editing is decent, and the transitions move swiftly and give a sense of speed and the story with what limited cinematography we have for the time. W: The writing is simple but effective. Some claim that the pathos as they put it is limiting the film and not allowing it to be as good as it can be. However, we have seen the Tramp 12 times prior to this, and this is the last outing. Giving this comedic character a sense of compassion and sympathy at this stage is where the story should progress. Rather than leaving it in the purely farcical realm. We have completeness and sadness that often appears in great comedy, and from the very first scene with the Tramp and the blind girl, we have a pleasant mix of longing with pratfall comedy. C: It is 1931, and Fritz Arno Wagner is continuing to put Hollywood cinematography to shame. Meanwhile, in Hollywood, Chaplin has brought along his old standby in Roland Totheroh, and he provides the standard for a Chaplin outing. The angles on some shots are nice, and some of the shadow work is pleasant, but nothing outstanding. A: At the beginning of the film, it says it is in pantomime, which implies over the top acting and with subtly and nuance removed from the piece. Which would be fine, save for the fact that it does have these things due to the previously mentioned pathos. Which forces me to be meaner on some of the more weak acting exhibited by the rest of the crew. Chaplin is excellent and very few people have such command of body language as he. The blind girl did not always feel blind, but we are still in the early days of cinema, so it is slightly excusable.  S: The opening of the film is annoying in terms of sound. We have mumbled audio from several characters, and then the Tramp appears and then silence. Which seems to imply yes films have dialogue now but let us enjoy this nostalgic throwback. Which is an excellent way of presenting the film, but in terms of audio quality, it is weak, and we could have had that same effect while presenting clear audio to the viewer. The rest is standard silent film fare. PD: The sets are sets of the era, and they took effort, but nothing stands out, especially when one knows what is coming in the 1930s in regards to set design. BA: Costume design is again very Hollywood and of the era. Nothing makes it feel all that special save for the Tramp himself. EVO: Thoroughly enjoying and while the comedy is not on par with the circus or modern times. It offers the viewer so much more and allows us to see how romantic films should be done. I kid you not. Look at most of the great romantic movies, and you will find that the romance in the film is left in the background and only adds to the overall work. Like a lovely sauce over a delicious meal.

8.7,7,City Lights,"OCT 19, 2019","Day and night. Day and night. This is how the film travels making sure that both of them are present at once. City Lights Charlie Chaplin's boxing match is not a serious match. I know that's obvious. But it is not. Not expected. At the back your thoughts, you are always waiting to get things serious. Gritty. Bloody. Brutal. Intense. And it is these films that makes us expect these things from a genre as such. Not even touching the Rocky milestone, I am just playing around Raging Bull by Martin Scorsese and Battling Butler by Michel Keaton- someone from Charlie's days itself. They've all tried to plaster the sincerity of that job on screen. You can joke around, fool around as much as you like but that sport is respected with a jarring punch when the time comes. Not to say that Charlie doesn't respect it. His method of living up to that ""dutiful"" objective is somewhat different. Nay, not different. Mature. Ahead of time. He doesn't pay homage to those heavy lifters by putting them in the ring, but does it so elegantly in the dressing room. From hard work to the stakes that are played every night on the screen, everything is mocked or more accurately notified in Charlie's dictionary. There is a sense of pride in carrying that note. And maybe that is why he has crafted such an empathetic and a low key character in the rest of the screen time. He is wreck but an adoptable one. Another thing that makes this film incredibly different than the others is the jokes. All the jokes are an elaborative comic sketches that takes energy along with time for it to work, from you. And then there is the end of the tunnel in the City Lights. A purely unconditional and innocent act that penetrates your emotion as that good old symbol of love arrow does. The birds fly and sing by merrily.",amheretojudge

7.3,9,Army of Shadows,"JUL 22, 2022","To capture the sense of fatalism this film portrays is no easy task, even when dealing with a story set in the midst of war, in this case during the **** occupation of France, because most of the time it's not given the right dimension, but that's the actual main strength of Army of Shadows. Its characters are really fighting in the shadows, and one mistake or betrayal means death. Army of Shadows takes place during a war, but it's not a war film. It certainly involves espionage, but it's one that feels much more rooted in what that actually entails, rather than anything sensationalist. This story is about the fear and tension of living that way, battling that fight. It's a suspenseful experience focused on keeping you in that state, so if you get more of a thrill from experiencing that stress than you would from action sequences, this film deserves your full attention.",JLuis_001
7.3,10,Army of Shadows,"SEP 16, 2021",An experience that can not be defined. The story is slow but really effective. and the cinematography is a masterpiece. The precision that Melville had in this movie is beautiful and each shot of the movie could be framed and hanged on the wall. The opening of the movie is marvelous. it showed the conquering of Paris with just a slight decrease of the angle of the camera. The colors of the movie give the feeling of coldness and dilemma. The movie ends with one of the most unsettling killing scenes of all time and the end credits are all the characters smiling in small circles. these are just a few reasons that this is one of the greatest movies and my favorite of all time.,Stamacho
7.3,6,Army of Shadows,"SEP 3, 2020","Apparently, a whole bunch of people seem to think that Army of Shadows is just superb, while I find myself, not for the first time, wondering just what it is that French filmmakers are trying to accomplish when they produce a film. I mean, I know a few things about the Resistance. I've read a few things about the Resistance. I admire these people for their courage and sacrifice. But this film does little or nothing at all to illuminate their accomplishments. Very early in the we meet a character who claims to be a traveling salesman. He says he was arrested because he happened to be walking through a square or plaza just as a riot or something erupted. And this could well serve as the epitaph for most of the characters in the film, who do little besides smoke cigarettes and talk about who was just arrested and who might be arrested next. You'd think that given two hours and twenty-five minutes of footage someone might've found the time to film a raid or two or maybe some sabotage. You'd think they could get deeply into the characters so that the audience get to feeling a little invested in what's happening on the screen. You'd think, if this film is such a masterpiece, that a little suspense or excitement might be building by the time we pass the one hour mark. But you'd be wrong. The film is as flat as a pancake. The characters are cardboard. The action is almost non-existent. And if the French didn't like it . . . well, what more need be said?",HotelCentral
7.3,7,Army of Shadows,"DEC 27, 2019","One of my childhood's favourite films (I'm French). I kept a vivid memory of some of the most gruesome scenes. It is probably the best film about the French resistance. For this accuracy not only in facts, situations but, more importantly, its existentialist, sombre, but powerful tone it is a superior film. However, aside from some beautiful scenes, Melville's cinematography feels very bland and dated in many unnecessary wide scenes (e.g. the Wehrmacht march, the description of the camp at the beginning). It seems the camera is too passive, too far from the action. The voice overs, always a sign of despondency for a filmmaker, feel too dry and awkward. Compared with a Tarkovsky's depiction of the similar WWII struggles, Lino Ventura's asides should have been conveyed by the camera not by words.",OlivierPiel

7.3,9,Army of Shadows,"AUG 25, 2017","On the surface, there is not a lot of satisfaction in watching Army of Shadows. Set in the 1942, the French resistance runs operations against the **** that either outright fail, fizzle out, are aborted, or are minor victories. There is no climax or crescendo to these depictions. There is no honeymoon period with director Jean-Pierre Melville leaving no time for those in the resistance to lick their wounds or reveal in victory, instead dumping them in the next situation. There is no telling what will come around the bend for those in the resistance, instead they are doomed figures restricted to hiding in the shadows and await their own demise, all while fighting for the future of a **** France. Powerful, solemn, tragic, and cold, Melville's Army of Shadows continues to find supporters due to its stirring depiction of men and women uniting to fight for their country with no expectation of success, reward, or glory. Instead, they do it because they must, if their children are to ever know freedom. Criticized for glorifying Charles de Gaulle by French critics in 1969, Army of Shadows wound up getting forgotten and only received an American release in 2006. The odd part, of course, is that De Gaulle is in one scene and, if anything, the film does anything but glorify the resistance. They are the heroes of this tale, yes, but Melville is entirely honest about the resistance. These are not wholly good men or women. Their cause may be a valid and heroic one, but their means and willingness to kill those who inform on them certainly calls into question just how truly ""good"" the members of the resistance are. Pitted against the ****, it is impossible to not root for the resistance, but Melville never shies away from those seedy elements that show the duality of evil on both sides of this conflict. Just because one side has a good cause does not mean all of the evil done in the name of the cause is entirely justified. While Melville himself had experience fighting with the resistance, even he recognize that the means used by the resistance were not always savory and worthy of praise, even if their cause was one in which he fully believed. With cold, flat blues and grays adorning the film, it is impossible to not come away believing this to be a solemn and melancholy work. It thrills and keeps the viewer hooked, but beats you down with unrelenting bleakness. While these men and women lay their life on the line every day to free France from the ****, one thing is absolutely certain: they will all die. They are operating on a set clock that, at any moment, could end with them being caught and tortured. As a result, perhaps the only possible future for them that gives them any sense of relief or bliss is their ability to commit suicide via a cyanide capsule when they are caught. None of these characters live to see France liberated, nor do they expect to be able to see this event. Rather, they fight to advance that possibility and open the doors for others to finish what they have started. In many ways, their mission is just an elongated suicide mission. It is hopeless and it will kill them, but is more valuable to their country and fellow man than words could ever hope to describe. Perhaps the most prevalent theme in the film is just how difficult it is to truly resist an oppressive government such as the ****. It is in this depiction that Army of Shadows reveals just how little it seeks to romanticize its heroes. Showing them murder people or escape capture just to put themselves in a position to have success on a mission, something inevitably goes wrong for this band of rebels. No matter what they do, no matter how perfectly thought out and executed, there is always some extenuating circumstance that necessitates their retreat or aborting of the mission. In large part, this is due to the overwhelming presence of the Gestapo. Like a band of stormy weather bearing down an unwilling city, it does not matter how prepared you because they will engulf you eventually. The resistance can hide in any number of shadows they want to, but the **** will always be right around the corner ready to arrest them, torture them, and let them wither away in a cell. It is the equivalent of standing in a room with the wall and ceiling closing in on you. There is no escape, but you sure as hell with try to fight against the wall before it crushes you.",Spangle

7.6,4,Touch of Evil,"SEP 27, 2024","On honeymoon with his new bride, a Mexican narcotics officer is unwittingly drawn into a web of crime and corruption when he witnesses a fatal car bombing. Following the case with interest, he's repulsed by the brusque attitude and morally-questionable methods of the local authorities. This is particularly true of their notorious lead detective, Quinlan, whose dubious past hangs like a rumbling storm cloud over the whole town. Like most late-period noir films, Touch of Evil is a wash of pulp and grit, with the seedy subject matter providing a sense of persistent danger and the black-and-white film stock pumped for all the grain and contrast it can muster. Orson Welles, sitting in the director's chair, may have gone overboard in his quest to probe these depths, although post-production on the film wasn't exactly trouble-free and he was eventually ousted from that post en route to a studio-mandated final cut. The result is a jumbled narrative, stocked with far too many loud characters and pointless subplots, albeit one with a stylish, progressive look and feel. Welles is good on the screen (he also plays the shady, multifaceted gumshoe Quinlan), but the double-billing may have been more than he could manage at this stage of his career.",drqshadow

7.5,9,Playtime,"OCT 5, 2024","A passion project for director (and reticent star) Jacques Tati, who exhausted his network of financial benefactors and most of his personal fortune to see it through, PlayTime is a difficult film to categorize. It’s both a comedy and a commentary, pondering the necessity of cutting-edge comforts by mocking and discrediting them. Tati stars as Monsieur Tulot, a Chaplin-esque character who wanders into a sleek new commercial mega-center seeking... something? Maybe a job? We’re never really sure, and it isn’t important anyway. In pursuit of a supervisor, Tulot grows hopelessly lost in the vast, glass-and-steel confines of the corporate maze. After the better part of a day, he finds his way back out to the street, only to round a corner and re-enter through the residential and entertainment gates. These areas, too, are modern to a fault. Big ideas accomplished as part of some larger, grander plan, but completely dysfunctional in a day-to-day sense. While much bubbles under the surface, particularly the director’s feelings about a then-recent remodel of downtown Paris, the film employs an extraordinarily light touch. Its plot is simple and fleeting; dialogue a mere afterthought. Most of its focus is dedicated to an onion skin of recurring visual gags that interlace, interact and compound one another. Like an orchestra, revisiting old melodies in a new context, the humor swells and fades. We explore it from fresh angles, enjoy it in different ways, find its influence everywhere. The lack of up-front, traditional storytelling belies the wealth of detail in most every background. Sometimes there are half a dozen silly bits going on at once, and none are front-and-center. A fabulously funny picture, but you’ll need to seek out almost every laugh. As Tati had full control of the set, he was afforded unusual levels of creative control. This empowered him to insist upon 70mm film stock and to indulge his pickier compositional habits. The end result is a film that looks astonishingly sharp and vibrant, even half a century later. Of course, this nearly cost him everything, as his production ran far over budget and was not immediately well-received. In retrospect, though, what does history really remember? The films that came in on-time and met the investors’ estimates, or those that best captured the creator’s vision? I have no doubts where this one falls. You can’t afford to miss the long, chaotic scene inside a club on opening night.",drqshadow

It's certainly worth noting musicals are probably my least favourite genre, but I'm still more than capable of finding entertainment with them - e.g. 'The Greatest Showman', 'The Sound of Music' and others. 'Singin’ in the Rain', however, simply didn't connect with me. There's one, maybe two, good songs that I had already heard, while Gene Kelly (Don) is solid fun in the lead role. The premise, minus the music, is actually very interesting, what with the silent film transition era. Given it's a musical, though, they don't delve as deep into that as I wanted. None of the songs, aside from the previously alluded to ""Singin' in the Rain"", landed well with me, I kinda found them a chore to sit through to be frank. Elsewhere on the cast, aside from Kelly, I found Debbie Reynolds (Kathy) alright but Donald O'Connor (Cosmo) a little irritating - he tries too hard, for my liking.

I have to admit that the camera effect that distorts perspective is surprising. The way it explores obsession, love, and emotional and physical paralysis; I like that it touches on so many themes. It's surprising how they played with the limited technology available at the time. The steep urban landscapes are very beautiful; they somehow play a crucial role in the narrative. It's interesting to learn about some fears and psychological themes that perhaps aren't talked about but exist, such as phobias. The use of colors, such as green, associated with Madeleine, and the visual composition of the settings reinforce the themes of obsession, illusion, and duality. The environments play with light, shadows, and perspectives to create a constant feeling of tension, bewilderment, and impending tragedy. Personally, I liked and enjoyed the plot of the film and in some ways how much they managed to achieve so that the view of the film and the little they had for its recording was enough for the public of its time to play with the lights and scenes to the extent that it was possible.",NiurkaVqzB1025
8.6,6,Vertigo,"SEP 18, 2024","Jimmy Stewart's fourth and final collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock, Vertigo casts him in the role of John Ferguson, a detective whose life unravels when he develops acrophobia during a rooftop foot chase. A troubling picture in many ways, from its complex, effectively unsettling filmmaking to the distressing personal changes undertaken by Ferguson in the third act. Hitchcock is, of course, a master of the craft and there's much to be learned from his efforts behind the camera (the now-infamous dolly zoom, tricks with lighting and foreshadowing, a casual pace that somehow never seems to grow stale) but also plenty cause for concern regarding the actions of his on-screen counterpart. In a Hitchcock film, it's nothing new for a visibly older gentleman to effortlessly draw the affections of a young blonde. Stewart's no exception in this film, pulling buxom Kim Novak (twenty-five years his junior), but his particular brand of obsession quickly grows dark and insistent, leading to some very squeamish scenes as he draws close to unraveling the conspiracy that's ensnared them both. Ferguson ultimately pays a price for this turn, but his greater judgment is never lain bare on the screen. Rather, it's abruptly left to the scrutiny of the viewing audience, with more than a nudge to suggest he may not be completely without alibi. Expertly concocted and tragic from a bird's-eye perspective, but worrying from a more introspective one.",drqshadow

But in the end you realize taht it is all of what it **** story is breathtaking, I got into it in the very first scenes and up until the very last ones. 'Vertigo' subtly oscillates between thriller, drama, sci-fi and noir genres amongst others. I had instantaneous empathy for Scottie (played by James Stewart). His acting is top notch, just as Kim Novak's one (as Madeleine). The plot is complicated but without being obscure. Characters are intertwined in the most poetic ways. Obviously the chase scenes may be lame at times. The morale is great.Environments and camera shots are amazing, especially those in the nature, as they are complimented by one of the most appropriate and powerful soundtrack. Bernard Herrmann's music does an incredible job all along, guiding us deep through the intricate and ever-changing emotions of the **** I watched 'Vertigo' in its restored version, the colours were terrific, and add a depth to the context and the scenery. Effects of lights are also to be mentioned.Certainly there are numerous turns of events in the relations of the protagonists that simply are inconceivable these days, the first examples being the major age gap, and the way the man can be seen as a profiteer from the fragility of the woman.

8.6,10,Vertigo,"MAR 14, 2022","I am a massive Hitchcock fan; this great director ain't called the Master of Suspense for nothing. Anyway, Vertigo is one of the truly great ****. It is a thriller of undeniable complexity not only in plot but also in characterisation. It is implausible too i give you that. I will admit the first time I saw this, I didn't understand this, then again this is the sort of film that you need to see more than once. In all departments, this movie is a masterpiece and my all time favourite Hitchcock. For those who say this is the worst movie ever, you would beg to differ if you saw genuine crapfests like Disaster Movie, Home Alone 4, NeverEnding Story 3 and Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2. They are a trillion times worse than this without a shadow of a doubt. What makes this movie great? When I re watched this, I got goosebumps. It is quite chilling, suspenseful and extremely haunting. The complex plot tells of a retired cop with a terror of heights who is hired by Gavin Elster to follow his suicidal wife. In the end, he falls in love with her but can't stop her falling to her death. Months later he sees a woman bearing strong resemblance to her, and is drawn into a web of deceit and obsession. There are so many strong moments here, especially Scotty following Madeline up the tower only to witness her falling to her death, but also of the San Francissco locations giving a dreamlike quality to an already dark and complex movie. The screenplay is sophisticated and sharp as well. And I have to mention Bernard Hermann's score, it was phenomenal, along with Miklos Rosza's score for Spellbound and Hermann's for Psycho this is the most memorable score in any Hitchcock film, and is guaranteed to have your hairs standing up on the back of your necks. The direction from Hitchcock is simply masterly. The cinematography isn't dated at all. It is stylish and full of contrasts of dark and bright colours, and is also very brooding and intense. I had very little problem with the film's pace and length; in fact let me rephrase that I had no problem with it. I felt actually that Torn Curtain had a much slower pace, and for me that film while good is one of my least favourite Hitchcock movies. The acting I thought was exceptional. Kim Novak starts off a little wooden, but she is certainly very beautiful and enigmatic. In the duel role of the suicidal wife and the woman bearing resemblance to her, she does an in general excellent job, considering both are extremely demanding roles. About James Stewart, whether he was a racist I don't know, but simply I don't care. Whether you are racist or not, it shouldn't matter when it comes to acting and films. What matters is that Stewart was a great actor who rarely gave a bad performance. In this film, he gives one of his best performances, **** his Mister-Nice-Guy persona with a dark, brooding and truly complex characterisation. Barbara Bel Geddes also gives a terrific performance as Midge. All in all, a superb film, that deserves recognition as one of Hitchcock's best films. Seriously, it is one of the most effective depictions of romantic fatalism in all of cinema. An unforgettable masterpiece, 10/10 Bethany Cox",kyle20ellis
8.6,7,Vertigo,"NOV 23, 2021","Any fan of Alfred Hitchcock will have heard of Vertigo - its held in high esteem by fans of his as well as fans of classic mystery and thriller movies in general. This movie, as others of its time, uses a heavy classical score to add a strong air of mystery and suspense, with the different instruments (such as strings and drumlines) putting across how the director wanted the audience to feel about the different scenes (like in the equally well known and regarded 'Psycho'). When I think of this being used to such an effect in a modern movie, the first one that comes to mind being Jurassic Park and you certainly can't argue that was used to add to the atmosphere, to make the viewer (hopefully) feel overawed and taken aback by the scale of it all, given that particular story. The opening titles to this movie are quite psychadelic, depicting multiple colours in a kaleidoscope type sequence, its quite hypnotic and very mysterious. There's one other scene that portrays John clearly in a deep sleep, having a disturbing dream, or more of a nightmare, which is highlighted by bright multi-coloured neon lights flashing across him, so there is a strong effort to put across tension through colour, which makes sense given the original movie dates from the late 1950s and colour in film was presumably fairly new then (correct me if I'm wrong). Its clear fairly early on that both the main characters are somewhat mysterious - we learn that John, or Scottie as he's sometimes referred to, has this acrophobia very early on but yet its clearly put across that what he witnesses early on isn't what caused this phobia to form, rather it highlighted that he already had it and we don't really know where this originally came from, so even if though minor, you wonder about the background of this person. The way he puts himself across on screen, you can't help but wonder about his motives and background as well, so he is rather mysterious in a sense, although much more mysterious is the other main character, Madeleine. She is, obviously, a rather fragile woman, who keeps things to herself but even from a distance John can see that things aren't necessarily as they may seem... the friendship or even romantic element between the two is quite intriguing, as John becomes more and more fascinated by her. She is very coy and as a viewer its a case of the fact that she gives away so little, that makes you more intrigued to find out more. However, this is only one half of the movie, after it takes a sinister turn and certainly there are a couple of plot twists present in the movie, one of which I felt was more obvious, for want of a better term, than the other. The ending is rather shocking and very sudden, given the lack of ending credits - instead the last scene is shown and it cuts abruptly to the 'Paramount Pictures' screen, which I suppose gives it more impact. I'd say that after shortly after a certain point, after the first plot twist (if you can call it that) occurs, you may have an idea of where the story is going, although its not entirely confirmed until close to the end but even then, the ultimate outcome is still rather shocking. If your prepared to watch and follow the story right through to the end then it should have some impact, although it may move a little slowly for you given on what you prefer. This movie is mainly about the characters, although the story itself is obviously rather well thought out. Given the age and type of movie that it is, there isn't alot of action as such, there's no strong violence or language or obviously CGI of course but then this is a different type of movie, its really about putting across a constant air of mystery and intrigue about these characters and if your happy to buy into it and follow the story through John's eyes then its certainly an enjoyable watch. Yes I'd recommend this movie. The performances or characters, especially that of the two main characters portrayed by James Stewart and Kim Novak are both very well portrayed and there's quite a strong sense of mystery and intrigue put across throughout.",DawdlingPoet

8.6,10,Vertigo,"APR 5, 2020","I remember watching Vertigo with my mom when I was about 13 and still wet-behind-the-ears in most respects when it came to film. I remember my mom holding this movie in an unusual esteem and personal engagement that she so rarely held anything in. My mom was my mom though, and when she loved something, she really loved it, more than anyone has loved anything else, and this, to her, was one of those movies. I didn't fully get it as a kid. Where movies were supposed to make you feel emboldened and secure in your values, this strange new kind of movie flew in the face of that, and seemed to like making you feel cold, naked, and dumb. It's been years since then, and I've seen this movie quite a few times. It's the perfect, endlessly-rewatchable thriller. Knowing the conclusion to the whole affair actually improves, holding the audience captive in perfect suspense, with each insidious narrative turn tightening the noose around the audience's neck. And when the conclusion does arrive, the first-time unassuming audience is shocked, but not offended. All along there were clues, inaccuracies that could only possibly amount to one conclusion. It's not so much that the audience forgets these clues as much as they choose to forget these clues, preferring one ""truth"" over another. It's this predicament that our protagonist, Scottie Ferguson, finds himself. However, his actions run perpendicular to the audiences wishes, turning up every stone, prying at every loose end until inevitably he undoes whatever happy ending he wrote for himself. It's his feverish search for ""the truth"" that makes him such a tragedy, and, to his friend and living-partner Midge, a comparatively well-adjusted, capable woman, such a mystery. He's the kind of paranoid, troubled individual who gets by on the notion that people are never really paying attention to the right things. His ""truth"" here is the mystery of one Madeleine Elster, a wife of an old friend who he (meaning the friend) believes to be possessed/hypnotized/some odd thing. Less important to Scottie are the specifics, choosing instead to understand a ""bigger picture"" that chronically eludes him. Hitchcock's direction perfectly compliments the sadness and claustrophobia of the film, which is shot in film's favorite city, San Francisco, which just so happens to be my home city. The film prefers quiet over loud, dimly lit, gothic cathedrals with narrow, dark corridors, paired with voyeuristic figures looking on like a moth attracted to lit. It prefers empty city streets and lifeless, seemingly abandoned docks. It's the city as intimate and naked as it comes. Not so much Norman Rockwell as it is Edward Hopper, the film is photogenic as all-get-out, but unbearably lonely. The lighting enhances the mood, using shadows at the edge of the screen to draw its figures together, obscuring desired women-as-objects under sickly green curtains. Vertigo take its audience's plaintive hopes for some virtue or nugget of personal triumph, and, rather than lazily turn it against them, draws upon our collective sadness for inspiration. In the end, Scottie is an everyman, living only to view goodness and light through some distant lens, and is simply the victim of being too observant, too clever, and too skeptically honest to ever really leave well enough alone. He's an emblem of the eternal shifting mass of the chronic, who remain miserable in their search for fulfillment, yet blinded by its need for closure. When the ideal presents itself, reality follows, ever-mocking, ever-naked in its approach.",Sinews

7.9,6,Notorious,"FEB 17, 2025","Hitchcock teams with Ingrid Bergman and screenwriter Ben Hecht for the second time in as many years, following their Oscar-nominated collaboration in Spellbound. Bergman plays an emotional wreck in Notorious, on the rocks after her father is convicted of a war crime and swallows a dose of cyanide in prison. In the midst of a bender, she’s snared by a cocky government agent (Cary Grant), who whisks her off to Rio and promises rich rewards in exchange for a touch of undefined espionage work. Once in Brazil, things get messy as the G-Man falls in love with her and the details of her new gig are made clear: reconnect and flirt with an ex-suitor (Claude Rains) to learn the details of his **** smuggling scheme. Grant and Bergman are meant to be tragic lovers here, government-backed co-conspirators who are driven apart by circumstance just as they discover the flicker of mutual enchantment. Instead, they act more like catty teens with a grudge. Her seductive performance needs to be convincing to effectively reel in their target, but Grant sees betrayal with every fluttered lash and his jealousy also brings out the worst in her. They orbit, collide and recoil constantly, bickering through most of their status checks (maybe he wasn’t such a great choice as handler) and often threatening to blow their own cover. As a civilian, she can’t be reasonably expected to maintain her composure amidst so much drama, but he’s an experienced agent and should already know the score. Fortunately, their quarry is too lovestruck to see through the ruse, or at least to pay much mind until he’s already in too deep. I found that quandary, a manipulation victim’s desperation to extricate himself without exposing the goof to his superiors, far more interesting than the petty squabbles of the leading duo. Sir Alfred does a great job of ratcheting the tension beyond the point of comfort (his specialty), the cinematography is customarily magnificent and the screenplay features twists upon twists upon twists, but those central amateur acts (and I don't mean the actors' performances) threaten everything. For a bunch of alleged international masterminds, nobody involved seems especially good at keeping a secret or reading a tell. Love stories were hardly a **** forte at this point, either, so it’s no great surprise that the leads’ romantic sparks are so forced and superficial. Hitch must’ve figured we’d accept an uncomfortably long make-out session - famously long, in fact - in lieu of chemistry, because we see little reason for these two to feel so attached beyond the swapped spit. It’s a compelling drama all the same, with an appropriately ruthless climax, but one that’s hamstrung by its dedication to the wrong kinds of intrigue.",drqshadow

7.9,7,Notorious,"MAR 19, 2021","I confess that I expected more from this film. It's good, but it didn't surprise or impress me like others from the same director. Alfred Hitchcock is not only one of the most outstanding film directors ever, he is also one of the most prolific, I think. And the truth is that some of his films are better, and others not so much. It depends on the tastes of each one. And this film, a good film, I repeat, did not seem that interesting or surprising to me. The plot begins well, with a judicial sentence from a German spy, caught on American soil, but then focuses on his daughter, Alicia. And the fact is that I was never able to have any sympathy for the character, who seemed to me a spoiled, self-destructive and foolish girl. The last choice, in my opinion, for an international espionage operation. In any case, she is precisely the one chosen to infiltrate a group of **** living in Brazil, thus having the opportunity to clean up her honor. In the midst of all this, there is a romance between her and the agent who recruits her. As I have already suggested, my biggest problem with this film was the little sympathy I felt for the main character. And that invariably leads me to speak of Ingrid Bergman... to say that she is not to blame for this. The character did not please me and this does not in any way call into question the impeccable work of the actress who, again, gives us an excellent dramatic work. In fact, one of the most interesting points of the film is the way she and Cary Grant act together. They work wonderfully and build good romantic chemistry, restrained but very elegant. Director Hitchcock is the master of suspense. This film is by no means the most accurate example of the director's abilities, which has excelled in films such as ""Rear Window"" or ""Psycho"", but it does not disappoint fans. The espionage plot provides all the elements necessary for a good thriller. Cinematography is important in the work of the director, with a skillful and complex work of filming, an intelligent use of light and shadow, and an elegant and visually beautiful black-and-white, which has surely intentional similarities with aesthetics of cinema noir.",FilipeNeto
7.9,9,Notorious,"MAY 20, 2020","The end is the climax. The clues of the film are naturally explained, without deliberately creating suspense, focusing on the expression of the character's feelings and heart, and the game of the last scene is also quite exciting. The whole film is complete and interesting. The protagonists and actresses performed very well. Together with the background of the era just after World War II (the sensitive topic of uranium mines) and the beauty of light and shadow in black and white films, it is quite charming. At the end it was neat and tidy, and the closed fascist will punish the fascist.",mnemosyne

8.7,9,Rear Window,"AUG 27, 2025","It's incredibly challenging to write a review of this film - so many ideas and layers of cinematic storytelling are embedded within it, and so many dissertations and essays have been written about it, that the very notion of capturing it all in a review feels excessively grandiose and overwhelming. Rear Window is such a comprehensive film in terms of cinematic language and richness of detail that any review will inevitably be incomplete and oversimplified. The film begins with the raising of the curtain - the opening of the window shades in Jeff's apartment, a perspective that becomes both Jeff's and the viewer's throughout the film. The soundscape consists of conversations, street noises, and occasional music played by a neighboring composer on his piano or a record player. The viewer is fully immersed, becoming Jeff, spying on the neighbors alongside him while also observing Jeff himself. Swelteringly bored, he watches his neighbors, each becoming a character in a silent film narrated by Jeff. The audience see them through Jeff's eyes and form impressions based on his commentary. Stella accuses Jeff of voyeurism for watching his neighbors. But isn't the viewer doing the same, observing both the neighbors and Jeff? Moreover, how reliable is Jeff as a narrator of what he sees? Is everything on screen a fiction conjured by Jeff's imagination, or perhaps a dream? Just as the film itself is a fiction crafted by Hitchcock's imagination. And how accessible is reality to our perception before it becomes part of our imagination? Jeff isn't eager to abandon his bachelor habits and marry Lisa, despite her captivating beauty and charm. Lisa is as alluring as Miss Torso, a dancer whose lingerie-clad exercises Jeff spies on. With Lisa, one could indulge in the passions of the newlyweds behind another, heavily curtained window. It's tempting to dedicate a song like ""Lisa,"" composed by the neighbor across the way, to her. But there's another side to marriage - another movie, or rather, another neighbor's apartment, tells a different story. There, Lars Thorwald, a traveling salesman once as free as Jeff, endures his wife's torment, as she lounges in bed all day in a negligee suspiciously similar to the one Lisa will soon wear while parading before Jeff. Yet abandoning Lisa feels inhumane - on the ground floor lives the Miss Lonelyhearts, imagining companionship and, in one scene, wearing a green dress the same shade as Lisa's. Central to these competing narratives is the story of Lars Thorwald and his wife. Jeff suspects Thorwald, fed up with her endless taunts, has murdered her - much like Jeff might wish to be rid of Lisa, whose talent, he claims, is creating trouble. Jeff's detective friend dismisses his suspicions, insisting it's just his imagination. Masterfully manipulating angles, Hitchcock shifts the camera's perspective to the detective's point of view, making him the primary narrator and disorienting the **** film's intrigue seems to hinge on whether Lars Thorwald killed his wife. But perhaps it's really about whether Jeff will marry Lisa? Everything happening across the courtyard strikingly mirrors what's happening in Jeff's apartment - or rather, in his mind. What he observes through the rear window, or in his imagination, becomes more real than what's in his room. Who in their right mind would watch Miss Torso or Miss Lonelyhearts when the stunning Grace Kelly is in the room? Yet Lisa, even in a negligee, must close all the curtains to become Jeff's focus. She jokingly says she'd only distract him from Miss Torso by moving across the courtyard and performing an hourly striptease. Indeed, Lisa truly captures Jeff's attention and becomes part of his reality only when she becomes part of his fantasy - leaving the apartment and entering Thorwald's, transforming into the daring heroine of the thriller Jeff and the audience are watching. Only then does she earn the ring on her finger, won through bravery and adventure. How much of Jeff's narrative about what's on screen reflects reality? Are we watching a murder investigation or Jeff's nightmare about marrying Lisa? How real is reality to us until it becomes part of our imagination? Studies from the early 1950s in the U. S. showed most Americans dreamed in black and white, but by the 1960s, most dreamed in color. This shift coincided with cinema transitioning from predominantly black-and-white to color. If dreams reflect our unconscious, how much does cinema's influence on dreams distort our unconscious, and how much does the latter reflect our direct experience rather than what we've seen on screens? Would Jeff have seen the real Lisa if he hadn't viewed her through his camera lens as the heroine of his thriller fantasy? C. S. Lewis wrote that imaginary beings have their insides on the outside - they are visible souls - and that a man can only be truly seen by placing him in the imagination and viewing him as a fairy-tale character.",Icivindur

8.7,8,Rear Window,"SEP 25, 2024","Hitchcock binds James Stewart to a wheelchair, deposits him at the picture window of a big city apartment and lets an idle imagination find its own drama. In this case, it's a murder most foul behind the drawn curtains of a neighboring unit. Costar Grace Kelly is refined and magnetic as the fashion conscious would-be fiancée; a model of smooth-talking elegance who, after initial doubts, is soon drawn into the intrigue of what's actually happened in that dark room across the way. After an argumentative start, Stewart and Kelly quickly settle in as a close-knit pair of obsessed observers, stoking each other's suspicions and inducing a steady shared vigil. The issue of their troubled romance is problematic, introduced in the first act and never truly resolved, but that doesn't bother me. I much prefer them as whispering cohorts with a gossipy secret, and the film already has more than enough subplots going on. Rear Window is a steaming pressure cooker of a suspense story, one which encourages viewers to second-guess their impressions and then punishes them for doing so. Like a large-scale stage production, the entire tale is told against a single backdrop: an unusually busy, uninhibited residential block. Sir Alfred's aptitude for frugal filmmaking is on full display here, utilizing every inch of screen to fill blanks and enrich the environment. It hustles, it bustles, it stirs in the morning and settles down after dark. We get to know each resident, to learn their habits and patterns, just like Stewart does from his lonely perch. Perhaps a little slow and meandering to start, once the pieces come together and our well-meaning voyeurs take matters into their own hands, it accelerates like a spooked getaway driver.",drqshadow

Some with importance as Lars Thorwald (played by Raymond Burr), some way less, as the sculptor on the ground floor. It is really pleasant to see all these protagonists evolve around each others for two **** the scenario remains interesting, I must say that the turns of events are not that much. There are some scenes deprived of ingenuity, overly long or simply contributing to make the plot falsely more complex.However I enjoy how the films goes from morality to psychology with the triad LB - Lisa - Stella, each giving his opinion about what is going on and how.",clem666

Static settings demand for things such as cinematography, writing and performances to have to be at their best as they are the story, what keeps attention. Hitchcock is stunning at creating sublime story's that simmer and build into thrilling crescendos and rear window is his best example of that with his idiosyncratic camerawork swoops like the voyeur the main character is. Grace Kelly is an engrossing independent brave socialite reporter and Stewart a cynical photographer but Ritter stands out as the sharp wit nurse. The script is exceptionally well written .

8.7,10,Rear Window,"MAR 14, 2022","Rear Window is a one of the more sophisticated Hitchcock films, and I will always consider it a masterpiece. It has tension, suspense, humour, has a strong voyeuristic tone to it and moves along at a good pace. The cinematography was truly excellent, dark in some scenes and beautiful in another. The script is fantastic and genuinely memorable(Thelma Ritter's wisecracks especially), likewise with the story, about a man who is convinced that his neighbour has killed his wife. I have always considered Rear Window's main merit to be the performance of James Stewart, he was perfect as Jeff, the man who is in a wheelchair, due to a broken leg. The other performances go without fault either, especially from the beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa and Raymond Burr in a chilling performance as ""the villain of the piece,"" Mr Thorwold. The music was expressive and atmospheric courtesy of Franz Waxman, and the climax was possibly the highlight of the film, after Stewart's performance. The 1954 version of Rear Window will always be a classic, not the inferior TV remake with Christopher Reeve. All in all, a must see for those who are fans of Hitchcock. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",kyle20ellis

Its interesting how Jeff (the main character) interprets the observations he witnesses. Its all a case of context, I suppose. Hearing him query other peoples interpretations of what he saw made me doubt the truth behind the circumstances. Its definitely a strong case of armchair detective, of course (how could it not?). It features a strong performance from both James Stewart and Grace Kelly, who is quick to challenge his assumptions. It makes me wonder what do others read in to otherwise seemingly every day activities and observations?. Its a slow builder, plot wise but it does well at pulling the audience in, questioning things.

This is one of the most famous films of Hitchcock and has been several remakes target. Like many of the films of this director, it could almost be staged as a play, given that almost all the action takes place in the same place: the apartment of the protagonist. The script is excellent, although moments of too much predictability. The performance of the main actors is impeccable and striking, and I consider this one of the best films of Kelly's career. The photograph also deserves a very positive note. The rest (soundtrack, costumes, scenery etc.) is reasonable without surprise or particular attention.

7.3,4,The Conformist,"SEP 29, 2024","In the age of fascist Italy, an ambitious young member of the secret police aims to leverage his lapsed relationship with a political dissident to curry favor and climb the ladder. Accompanied by his new bride, he travels abroad, does the recon, re-establishes contact and struggles to make the kind of decisive move his superiors are looking for. Participating in the assassination of an old acquaintance must have seemed so romantic and straightforward when it was just an abstract concept. Actually pulling the trigger once you've shared drinks together, after your wives have bonded over Parisian fashion, that's another matter entirely. Speaking in a purely technical sense, The Conformist is a marvel. Gorgeously framed and lit, with trend-setting photography and a crisp eye for detail, it's stylish, radiant cinema that emphasizes and enhances the chosen mood for each important scene. I found the script to be less inspired. Particularly so during the drawn-out second act, where our spy endlessly hems and haws about making a decision. Any decision, that is, not just the big, fat one at the center of all the swirling intrigue. For most of his life, he's survived in a detached state, merely going with the flow (nay, conforming) to avoid rocking the boat; this time such deferrals do him no good, yet he persists. History is littered with such men, following orders or standing mute while atrocities are carried out in their name, and while that's a valid point, it's tirelessly beaten and bandied about. The film isn't terribly subtle about any of its messages, operating with a proud moral superiority that I found stiff and redundant. It's so concerned with being IMPORTANT that it can often feel like a lecture. Good as a thought-stirrer, and outstanding as a visual specimen, but overwrought and wearying as a total package.",drqshadow

7.3,6,The Conformist,"DEC 20, 2017","Until I watched The Conformist my only experience of Italian filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci was 2003‘s The Dreamers starring Eva Green and Michael Pitt. Needless to say I found The Dreamers an easier watch, not least because the majority of that film is in English. The same cannot be said for The Conformist Bertolucci’s 1970 political drama. Spoken in Italian and French the film focuses on Marcello (Jean-Louis Trintignant) a young man starting a career in the Mussolini government. The film centers around Marcello’s mission to assassinate his former University Professor Quardri (Enzo Tarascio) who has fled to France. While this mission provides the essential plot, the film is essentially a character study of Marcello, the Conformist of the title. Through a number of flashbacks, Marcello’s childhood, marriage and his relationship with his parents are explored in detail. The flashbacks form the first half of the film and while they inform the events that follow the non-liner time frame along with the language barrier can be confusing at times. By exploring certain traumatic incidents in his childhood as well as the strained relationships with his morphine-addicted mother and his mentally ill father, we understand why Mercello is the way he is and why above all he strives to conform to the world around him, socially, politically and sexually. Mercello’s mission is further complicated by the presence of his new wife Giulia (Stefania Sandrelli) who believes that they are traveling to Paris for their honeymoon. The character of Giulia is deliberately irritating and when the Professors young wife (Dominique Sanda) is introduced she provides a huge contrast. The film then goes through a period of a becoming a love-quadrangle of sorts between Mercello, Quardri and their wives while the two men try to figure each other out. This in itself could have provided the basis for an entire film and in the wider context of the running time it feels a little rush. All the same everything that has gone before makes the climatic scene in the French mountains all the more powerful and we are now so deeply invested into Mercello’s character that he doesn’t need to speak. In a final dénouement the film flashes forward to the end of Mussolini’s dictatorship and we witness Mercello struggling to come to terms with his past. To reveal more than this would be a spoiler but lets just say the incident with the professor is not the only skeleton in Mercello’s closet. Your enjoyment of the film to some extent depends on your attitude towards subtitles. To me the only issue with subtitles is that it detracts from the performances, as your focusing on the text rather than the actor speaking. With repeat viewings this becomes less of an issue though and given its depth and complexity The Conformist definitely needs revisiting.",Domgwy
7.3,3,The Conformist,"MAY 30, 2016","Like some other reviewers, I was not impressed by the writing and the way the narrative was presented. It felt very disconnected, and sometimes confusing, with rough jumps between scenes, often making characterisation deficient. Perhaps it was a conscious decision aimed to convey Marcello's neurotic state and his need to belong, yet I felt that the camera-work alone did the job pretty well, especially the lighting (e.g. in the scene when we first see Guilia, in a striped dress, with moving light source patterned by the blinds, it reflects Marcello's mixed feelings about her), and the unorthodox angles. Also, I still wander if the narrative is objective, or maybe some of the scenes are Marcello's wishful thinking - while watching, I had a theory that the blue light indicated these, but it didn't quite hold up till the end. And, next to the ambiguous episodes, there are some annoyingly blatant parts. The metaphor of blind fascists was just too in-your-face. I wont give examples, look them up, there are quite some. The bit I liked about the plot was the suppressed homosexuality theme, under-stressed but sustained throughout the film with several moments of restrained homoeroticism, and the ending. I also liked the general air of the 30s, and the music - the credits song is currently stuck in my head. I'll quote a fellow reviewer here, who said something i fully agree with: ''A fine movie, but dry and difficult to relate to. I can't imagine many people calling this a favorite. I have a great deal of respect for its craftsmanship, above all, most notably because the filming is beyond gorgeous. '' Overall, while definitely a 9.5/10 for cinematography, The Conformist suffers from the need of a better and more coherent script. Which makes the movie sometimes very boring, confusing and frustrating. Maybe on a second viewing it might be better.",CalibMcBolts

From the shot construction, framing, and lighting, the cinematography is pure perfection. The score is fantastic and really captures the feeling of the film very well. The production design and costume design are also both exemplary and capture the essence of the era. For the rest of the film, it does not rise to the level of these production values. However, due to its setting in Rome during and after the time of Mussolini's reign, it truly makes for a captivating background. The story as a whole as it unfolds is riveting and, though it can be tough to follow at times, really keeps you engrossed throughout. There are quite a few moving parts and it requires some historical knowledge of the era, but all that said, The Conformist is a phenomenal work from Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci. One of the most beautifully shot films around, The Conformist is a true piece of cinematic art.",Spangle
7.3,9,The Conformist,"NOV 7, 2013","Bertolucci is another wunderkind in the industry, at the age of 30, his fourth feature film, THE CONFORMIST has been proved to be a timeless classic, which I feel privileged to watch it now for the very first time. Tilting camera angle, impeccable shots paralleling the moving train and zooming in from the external side of the window, sensual hues, cubistic buildings, punctilious light and shade deployment (Professor Quadri, the hunchbacked man being introduced by his silhouette), fluid ballroom dancing sequences, the bleak and cold-hearted manslaughter in a wintry woodland, all emerge as consecutive surprises and gustos along its non-linear narrative. Marcello (Trintignant), a newly-recruited fascist member in Rome, is assigned for an assassination of his old professor Quadri (Tarascio), who dwells in Paris now with her young wife Anna (Sanda), the film hops back and forth episodically in recounting the newly-wed Marcello’s matrimony life with Giulia (Sandrelli), a petit bourgeois trophy wife; their honeymoon to Paris with a clandestine aim to carry out the task until Marcello compellingly falls for Anna; meanwhile Bertolucci allocates episodes to sort out Marcello’s personal lives, his attachment with his amicable blind friend Italo (Quaglio), his drug-addicted mother (Milly) and lunatic father (Addobbati); but underneath his placid and gentile veneer, lies an unfading quandary, stems from his encounter with a pedophile (Clémenti) in his childhood and his latent homosexuality which pulses him to a perpetual and professed seeking of normalcy. Trintignant is exceedingly under-appreciated in his sophisticated and self-constrained portrayal of a man put in contradiction with almost anything around him, perfectly tallies with the political message of the film, a stooge, put-upon in order to rectify his own weakness, indiscriminately clutches any straw to obey conformability, while in the end, a sense of loss and disparagement is his own bitter fruit. Sanda and Sandrelli are stunning in their own distinctive beauties, the former is resolute, swinging both ways and emanating the like-a-moth-to-a-flame fatalism; the latter imbues a more traditional feminine allure with little clue about what’s in her husband’s mind. Also it is noteworthy to give credit to Georges Delerue, who produced a spellbound score underlining the varying tenors of Marcello’s state of mind. THE CONFORMIST is a pièce de résistancer with its idiosyncratic aesthetic charisma to crown Bertolucci as the most important auteur in Italian cinema after his illustrious progenitors!",lasttimeisaw

8.7,6,Pan's Labyrinth,"DEC 9, 2025","Pleasant disappointment. I’d always been told 'Pan’s Labyrinth' was a masterpiece, but after finally watching it, I feel it’s a good film that simply wasn’t what I expected. A lot of that disappointment comes from the imbalance between what the movie promises to be and what it actually delivers. Sergi López is phenomenal. His performance is brutal, razor-sharp, and practically carries the entire film on its shoulders. The depiction of Francoist Spain is suffocating, violent, and painfully real — genuinely terrifying. And it’s precisely because the political side is so strong that the fantasy feels pushed into the background, almost sidelined. I expected a story fully driven by dark fantasy with a war backdrop, but that’s not the direction Del Toro takes. Instead, the fantasy appears in symbolic flashes, tied to the protagonist’s psychology, rarely exploring what could have been a fully realized, inhuman world filled with extraordinary creatures. I was hoping for an explosion of creativity and breathtaking environments, but I ended up feeling the fantasy was surprisingly shallow. Sure, the Pale Man is iconic, but these moments are brief, and the “beyond” is barely developed. I finished the movie asking myself: Where is the labyrinth Spanish: Grata decepción. Siempre me pintaron 'El laberinto del fauno' como una obra maestra, aunque después de verla me parece que es una buena película, esperaba otra cosa completamente diferente. Gran parte de eso viene del desequilibrio entre lo que promete ser y lo que realmente ofrece. Sergi López lo hace impecable. Una interpretación brutal y tan afilada, que prácticamente sostiene toda la película. Una representación del franquismo asfixiante, violenta y que se siente real; da verdadero miedo. Y justamente por esa parte política, es por lo que la parte fantástica queda relegada a un segundo plano, casi marginada. Esperaba ver algo completamente dirigido hacia la fantasía oscura y de fondo una historia bélica, pero no es así. Del Toro hace lo contrario: la fantasía queda en destellos simbólicos, ligados a la psicología de la protagonista casi sin mostrar lo que podría haberse explorado de un mundo fantástico e inhumano, habitado por criaturas fantasiosas. Esperaba una explosión de creatividad y escenarios deslumbrantes, pero me quedo con una sensación de superficialidad. Claro que el Hombre Pálido es icónico, pero salen poco y no se profundiza en el más allá. Acabé la película preguntándome: ¿y el laberinto?",chriss17eu

8.7,9,Pan's Labyrinth,"OCT 28, 2025","Dark, twisted and meaningful, like the best fairy tales, Pan’s Labyrinth mixes elements of dream, fantasy, history and horror in a single, simmering vat. At its center is Ofelia, a young girl struggling to retain innocence in the aftermath of an ugly civil war. Though the conflict is officially over, resistance outfits still dot the countryside, disrupting the fascist transition with guerrilla raids and ambushes. As the adopted daughter of an occupying officer, Ofelia’s caught in the middle and uses her imagination to escape as often as she can. In the wilds of 1940s Spain, there’s plenty of room to indulge those whims. Amidst the split trees and stone monuments, she finds an overlap between fact and fable, where strange creatures roam the shadowy overgrowth and fill little heads with ripe delusions. Ofelia doesn’t always know who to trust, and neither do we. In these unstable political times, the right secret in the wrong ears can be fatal. Thus, everyone in town is extremely guarded and suspicious, and the mythical creatures in the girl’s fantasies follow suit. Tangible fears color her invisible fancies. Like the rebels she admires, though, and the pregnant mother she adores, Ofelia endures and persists. In both worlds. I’m not sure which side of the story is most unsettling. The dreams are certainly more vivid, which makes them more memorable. Writer/director Guillermo Del Toro sends this sweet young thing into all sorts of terrifying nightmare scenarios, dim and musky corridors of ancient evil with unsightly guardians. This is all incredibly realized, a genuinely disturbing realm of ornate uglies that borrows from and iterates upon the director’s preceding work in Hellboy. I fell into the mental trap of expecting less from a foreign-language film and was bowled over by the top-notch costume and atmospheric effects. Pan’s Labyrinth delivers on the premise and then some, lending an air of strange possibility to its fiction. This looks good enough to believe in. There’s ample heart to go with that imagination, too. Heavy heart, with a lot of looking-through-our-fingers moments, but heart all the same. It’s not easy to marry reverie with reality, to tangle the two until they reach a cloudy, extra middle ground, but Del Toro has managed it. The grandness of this drama, and the bittersweet nature of its twin conclusions, is a crooked parable on par with the Brothers Grimm.",drqshadow

The monsters are actually quite scary and gave me quite an intense ride from start to end. The whole film looks utterly visually stunning.

My only gripe with the movie is that it misrepresented falangism as fascism and presented the conflict as a black-and-white good vs bad struggle, when the reality was a lot more grey. But I fully realise that this wasn't the point of the movie, which is why I will still give it a 10.",Maxkho

8.7,8,Pan's Labyrinth,"FEB 13, 2022","I think this film was really my first contact with the work of Guillermo del Toro, a Mexican director who has done a colossal job of taking advantage of fantastic themes in his films. This film was one of the director's most cherished projects, and we can feel how much he committed and invested in it. Despite being a fantasy film and starring a girl, the film is quite intense and not suitable for younger children. All the action takes place in the final years of the Spanish Civil War: we follow Ofelia, a dreamy and kind-hearted girl, who travels to a remote place in rural Spain with her mother, in order to join Captain Vidal, a superior officer of the Francoist army whose mother got pregnant and who occupied an abandoned mill with a battalion to hunt down a group of communist partisans. From the start, it is quite clear that Ofelia dislikes her stepfather and her mother is determined to make her forget her real father, now deceased, by forcing the girl to treat him as a father. Indifferent to political issues, Ofelia pursues and finds a magical world in the forest around her new habitat. There, she meets a faun who tells her that she is, in fact, a princess, daughter of the King of the Enchanted World, who long ago left and was lost in the human world, living without knowing the anguish and longing for her true father. In order to return, she will need to complete three challenges and prove that her soul is still pure, that is, that she has not turned into a human. If we want to do a cold and harshly realistic analysis, this film will quickly crumble and show several weaknesses. The most obvious, for me, is the absolute insanity of a military man who insists on taking his companion, in a terminal stage of pregnancy, and a minor child to the battlefield. I also didn't like the feeling that the film ends up being so politically charged, with communist guerrillas being considered champions of freedom and with the demonization of Francoist soldiers. Anyone knows that there are no saints in war, and that atrocities are always committed on both sides. But I feel that we are being unfair if we continue to view the film from this perspective. Despite all this, this is a charming cinematographic work full of magic and dreaminess, which makes us want to believe in fairy tales again, to be in that girl's shoes. The film has an excellent cast of Hispanic actors (I don't know if they are all Spanish in fact) and is entirely spoken in Spanish, which for me was a bonus as it gives the film a very welcome additional realism. Ivana Baquero did an exceptional job on the skin of young Ofelia. Despite not showing his face, very well disguised, Doug Jones is the man who gives body, soul and life to two of the most memorable characters in the film: the wise faun and the terrible Pale Man, a monster that almost devours the protagonist. Jones gives us one of his best works in cinema. Surprisingly calm and terrifying, Sergi López turned his Captain into a character worthy of our hatred and contempt. In addition to these three great actors, the film also has splendid performances by Ariadna Gil, Maribel Verdú, Álex Angulo and César Vea. Being a Del Toro film, it is guaranteed that we will have a wide range of visual effects, CGI and characterization, all the highest quality and privileging the maximum of realism. In fact, we couldn't ask for more when it comes to all of this. There are a number of discreet and realistic CGI features, ranging from explosions and the intense green of the forest to the maze itself, fantastic and unreal, where an important part of the story takes place. The costumes are very good, especially Ofelia's dresses and the soldiers' uniforms. The scenarios, especially the labyrinth and the mill, are wonderful and the characterization of the fantastic characters was thought out in the smallest details. Cinematography makes clever use of color, shadow, light and shooting angles to achieve greater expressiveness and visual symbolism. No less important is the excellent soundtrack, with emphasis on the central melody, which has a sound that reminds us of the lullabies that mothers used to sing to children.",FilipeNeto

8.7,8,Pan's Labyrinth,"NOV 20, 2021","This is a fantasy horror film, with themes including rebellion, naivety, war and anarchism, among others. It is very atmospheric, with a good use of low lighting, often blue-ish tones are used during scenes set at night in the surrounding forests. I liked the music used, mostly classical in style, which added to the sense of authenticity somehow - its quite light and somehow mildly spooky or chilling at times. I probably ought to make a point of clarifying that this is a Spanish film - being both set in Spain and with the dialogue all in Spanish, so if you don't like subtitles then this obviously isn't for you. I felt that the visual effects were really quite impressive - it was quite an immersive film and often the visual effects made it seem rather unpleasant, think **** out comedy sort of thing (there's lots of mud, dirt, mucus etc.). I also felt it had a sense of childhood naivety about it. The main character, Ofelia, is obviously a child herself and doesn't seem to realise the potential danger she could be in by some of her actions, so she is certainly naive to an extent. The creatures brought to life presumably by CGI did seem quite convincing - there are many insects and flying creatures, for example. This is ultimately a rather dark and definitely more an adults version, or example of, a fairy tale and not one for kids to watch, due to the content. It had a sense of foreboding and the tension built up as the plot developed. I suppose, when I think about it, its perhaps a film depicting various extremes - from the naivety of childhood, a childs imagination come to life and the grim, dark realities of the real world, from things seen from the girls point of view, to the parents war mongering circumstances. Its set at a time of conflict and that conflict is quite clearly put across. Cast wise, Ofelia is played by Ivana Baquero. Her performance is good, as a curious, imaginative child who is keen to find out what secrets may be hiding nearby. You can see in her face her curiosity and also a sense of independence and of her being very determined to get to the bottom of thing. Capitan Vidal is played by Sergi Lopez, who comes across as quite chilling and unemotional. Carmen is played by Ariadna Gil - she also plays her part well, as a worried, nervous, loving yet undermined mother. Other cast members include Alex Angulo as Dr. Ferreiro, Maolo Solo as Garces and Roger Casamajor as Pedro. Content wise, as I say this film contains bloody violence, both human related and fantasy related instances, with bloody bodily injuries shown, plus some very strong language. It is quite frightening in tone, especially with the visual effects at numerous points and of course some of the themes, of war and anarchy, are quite dark. Due to this, the film carries a 15 rating. I liked the camerawork, with some scenes featuring camera shots from unusual angles, which I felt added to the fantasy element. It made some scenes look almost ethereal, with the camera seemingly floating around somewhat, to an extent. I thought some of the dialogue was relatively poignant, with some mentions relating to the senselessness of war for example.",DawdlingPoet

He expertly weaves to together the incredible world of the supernatural (and the monsters that inhabit it) that exist in his story, with the visceral reality of civil war in a world far more familiar to us.

Every second he's on screen I wanna punch him in the face.

El Laberinto Del Fauno takes you back to those old fairy tales or late evening's cartoon tales that connects an innocent kid to the dog-eat-dog world in a metaphorical tone. All of these would have been enough for a fairy tale but this is Guillermo's show all over the screen where color, background score and even tiny creatures floating around or background the screen factors in for this majestic art that it is. El Laberinto Del Fauno is exhilarating, to-the-point, well detailed and dramatic which isn't surprisingly for the kids; considering its premise, but for the adults as it is equally terrifying and beautiful in its own way and with the help of the maker it walks a fine line between it.",amheretojudge

The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre 4 Out Of 5 The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre is a tale about three partners going after the treasure and the irrevocable journey or adventure that it brings along with it. The inner politics depicted among the greedy friends and the good old ""morality"" conflicts that it raises, is the ingenious yet simply sensible take of the makers especially when the heat is communicated directly to the audience, it gets better as it ages on screen. It is rich on technical aspects like sound effects, background score, editing and art design. The primary reason the feature offers a satisfactory outcome is that not only is it unpredictable but is justifying with genuine reasoning which is the soul in here. The structure of the script may be familiar but its additional and side characters does make it worth keeping the audience engaged offering them enough work and art to explore in it. John Houston; the screenwriter-director, uses its smart adaptation wisely and brilliant execution skills on creating the anticipated vision on screen. The performance is decently acted by Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt but the real gem of the feature is Walter Houston who gives a memorable performance as a supporting cast.

7.2,10,Au hasard Balthazar,"MAY 10, 2022","Au hazard Balthazar in every frame has exceptional morality, intimidating representation of humanity as a whole manifesting in the grotesque nature of people getting satisfaction over dominants over animals! Opening in a delicate arrangement of piano notes interrupted by a donkey’s whaling cries (possibly Balthazar’s birth.), then back to the melancholy piano to the titles in a crumpled-up background. The very first shot is of young Balthazar feeding on his mother already representing the beginning of life, nurturing, and the miracle of creation. A hand slowly stroking Balthazar’s content back is Marie the woman in form of kindness wanting a friend to keep but over her shoulder a stern father, stating no in his heavy authority. Already the film has shown us the cruel, unjust yet reasonable dissections of the world. A family of loving kids represents childhood playing with the donkey in the hay, a excises in poetry shot of a swinging chair, and in the background grooming the donkey. Baptizing represents religion, love heart engraved on a bench, the cruelness of whipping, hard labor, being materialized and hooves metal is all extremely scary from Balthazar’s perspective of the world. Pitch folks chase like Frankenstein starts leading Balthazar's journey finding open gates almost like it's presenting a passage from hell to heaven. Strikingly shot, purposefully cruel characters looking down upon the donkey with no feelings. Fate made a hay intensity inducing sounds of rattling carriages to build tension and then silence with slowly creeping low piano keys lifting the moods. Youth is destroyed, and innocence vanished by the darkness of the world. Illness is presented by a bedridden small girl strangely feeding the donkey salt. Balthazar cheers up the children as the essence of childhood is fully captured in one short sequence. Only 9 minutes into the feature and already Au Hasard Balthazar has almost covered everything wrong and right about humans, that’s why this is one of the grandest films ever made. I was being reached on an emotional, thought-provoking level hardly any films give me. The main piano score music plays then rudely interrupted by a loud tractor representing the hard work humans go through to get to what everyone wants out of life, love, affection, safety, and purpose. We work because we have to serve society unless you’re ill seen early into the film. Marie represents many important aspects of society's statures femininity, beauty, pure-hearted, and gentleness but she’s placed within a terrifying circle of evilness. A brutal transition from Marie and her kind father to a gang of motorbike hoodlums pouring oil on the ground represents to me the endless void of crime in a saddening world. Balthazar with dread on his face is about to face bullying, the gang is going to pursue them but the audience already knows before something happens as Bresson's direction is flawless. Hardly any dialog is spoken in the first thirty minutes almost acting like a silent feature. The gang's first response is “A donkey neat, that's modern.”. The biker winks at the woman then the father without causing trouble (being outnumbered) whips the donkey quickly. Animals sense bad people but the bikers follow them as the left open the gates of heaven. The demons so to speak take revenge for not being noticed or feeding into their childish antics. Slowly walking Marie looks for leaves just like Balthazar looked for to eat in scenes prior is reflecting on Marie and Balthazar that they are both the same. They are beautiful, same morals, and live within a problematic world. Marie makes Balthazar a pretty flower, leaf coved crown almost like in the bible in a humble scene. Balthazar's expression is poignant he’s cleanly crying with joy looking back at her as she sits down to 10 seconds of silents apart from crickets. Suddenly she’s Powerless peaking through the narrow door watching in dismay of incoming trouble. Building again Bresons techie focuses on hands and feet shots for tension The shot slowly the biker hands slide ominously across the once scared bench of childhood hopes and dreams. He tries to touch her so she runs into the house as Balthazar is involved in horrific Dragging, nipping, taunting, and punching. Transitioning to choirs in church praying for god then the evil biker is there who will sing to bells ringing like the donkeys being a reminder. Bullying Balthazar continues, father in trouble from rumors then the camera moves inwards to Balthazar as a sign of heavy Obligation. Marie is too scared to make Gerald's crew escape the police but Balthazar is shot! We are empathizing with his sense of cold alarming doom. Balthazar’s final sacrament is phenomenal as I cried at the ending which is very rare for me, that’s how powerful the waves of sheep, bell sounds, and death of the saint donkey impacted me.",dannykay

And she was a very spiritual woman-she hated the word ""religous"" but she was an ordained minister of some sort( I myself have a very weak faith).

7.2,0,Au hasard Balthazar,"DEC 7, 2014","The discussion about Bresson has already been laid out between his fans who “get it” and the minority –to which I belong - within the minority of cinema viewers who actually care about art cinema, or Bresson for that matter, that hate Bresson with a passion. I hate Bresson for the same reasons others hate him: he makes films not to be enjoyed but to be endured, while forcing his worldview upon you. This, coming from a person who appreciates Bergman, Bunuel, Dreyer, Ozu and Godard, and who liked Jeanne Dillman and the Turin Horse. I can safely say Bresson is the only world wide acclaimed artistic director I can’t appreciate in any way. So he defies convention and tells the truth, great, if it were true, since he necessarily selects the facts to be presented in order to advance his view, rejects any moments of joy or pleasure, and presents a quite unreal world, like for example Gerard trashing the town bar while the other patrons keep dancing in Balthazar. So you show a donkey been beaten and that is considered moving, well, as others have pointed out, I can place a camera in front of beaten or abused animals and be moving, **** he breaks convention, excellent, if it translates into something interesting. Like someone else said, watch “Empire” by Warhol if you want to see a film breaking conventions. Hell, watch Jeanne Dillman, a film I very much enjoyed even with its length, dark view and non drama. So he rejects acting and casts non-professionals to deliver their lines looking at the floor, outstanding, if in some way I could understand the significance of this method. I’ve seen Balthazar twice, the second time in order to see if I had missed something, but no, there it was again, this extremely dry, pessimistic world, this uncomfortable, humorless and painful viewing experience, with nothing to pique your interest or stimulate your brain except that life is hell and then you die. Quite simply, Bresson bores me while annoying me to death. His movies are, like someone else said, “**** punch(es) to the gut”.",jacabiya

7.2,8,Au hasard Balthazar,"AUG 6, 2013","Critics sometimes with a zeal bind together in pact of unquestioned praise toward a film, Au Hasard Balthazar is a very good film, but just because its of a certain age, shot in black & white and made by a french director does not make it a 10. 8 to 8.5 would be more accurate. The film scenes are often very compact yet still somehow not taught, the pausing shots and the pointed lingering gazes the characters endlessly offer up, seem in this day and age a little heavy handed and serve to irritate more than they succeed in forcing contemplation, also I think some of the actors used though good, seem not of the first order of the best of french acting in this era, some characters seem a little stilted and artificially shallow in presentation Marie endlessly abused, Gerard consistently mean and sadist, the father soppy stern and prideful etc etc. its as though all seems to have been extracted from the general play of realistic dialog, except for the miserable moments. But still make no mistake this a great film, I just think is been fatly fed of the gilding of ego'd critics, to keen to demonstrate their intellect through protestation-al love of french art house cinema, for viewing i would advise being ready to match pace with the film to get the best out of it and not desire any jollity or resolution from the viewing. If the purpose of the cinema is to unrealistically depress then I would say it succeeds. some elements of plot movement and dialog are stilted or often merely implied, leading the viewer to interpret what has occurred in the gaps, this can be viewed as just plain awkward or a way of attempting to encapsulate through implication more than the film actually contains. Though this film uses the donkey centrally to link its characters, its a rather vile portrayal of the intrigue of drab french rural life in a small village, and how the unredeeming characters attempt to use each other, just as the donkey is used, maries sad path in this film has been deliberately calibrated to irritate the decency inherent in the viewer, in a way that seems contrived and very depressing with implied, if off camera ****, it seems as if all the characters have been engineered to agrravate as there is too much shade and not enough light, given that none of the characters seem to get or give a break to each other, in the relentless sadness of it all, but the general jist is that for all that we think we might gain for ourselves there is a lacking in life, that leads us in the end even with free will, often to be no happier in life than the seemingly martyred silent donkey in the field.",ancientscream

8.0,7,The Wild Bunch,"AUG 22, 2025","A Brutal, Beautiful Elegy for the WesternMy Rating: 7.8/10Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch is not merely a Western; it is a seismic event in cinema history. Released in 1969, this film doesn't just tell a story—it **** a mythology. It takes the romantic, clear-cut morality of the classic Western and drags it through the dust and blood of a changing world, leaving behind a masterpiece that is as controversial and challenging as it is **** film follows an aging gang of outlaws on the Texas-Mexico border in 1913, men who are relics of a bygone era struggling to find their place in the encroaching 20th century. Led by the world-weary Pike Bishop, they are not heroes or charming anti-heroes; they are hardened, morally ambiguous men bound by a frayed code of honor. The narrative is a powerful meditation on loyalty, obsolescence, and the brutal nature of survival when your time is running **** performances are nothing short of legendary. William Holden delivers a career-defining performance as Pike, embodying the weight of past regrets with a profound, stoic gravity. He is matched by Robert Ryan as his former partner, a man haunted by his own complex motivations. The chemistry of the entire ensemble, including Ernest Borgnine and Warren Oates, is palpable, creating a believable bond of camaraderie forged in violence and desperation.What truly sets The Wild Bunch apart is its revolutionary technique. Peckinpah's direction is a masterclass in visceral filmmaking. The groundbreaking use of multi-angle editing, blending rapid-fire cuts with lyrical slow-motion, turns violence into a horrifying ""ballet of death."" This stylistic choice isn't for shock value alone; it forces the viewer to confront the brutal reality of conflict in a way that was unprecedented at the time and has influenced countless action films since. Complemented by Lucien Ballard's gritty, sun-scorched cinematography and Jerry Fielding's unsettling, Oscar-nominated score, the film's technical prowess is **** warned, this is not an easy film to watch. Its pacing can be deliberately slow, and its characters are deeply flawed, making them difficult to sympathize with. The film's reputation for violence is well-earned, but it is purposeful, serving as a stark commentary on the sanitized gunfights of older **** any serious cinephile, The Wild Bunch is essential viewing. It is a complex, demanding, and unforgettable piece of American cinema that functions as both a thrilling action film and a poignant eulogy for a genre and an era. A true, if brutal, work of art.",Mohamed-Soliman
8.0,8,The Wild Bunch,"MAR 27, 2025","I just watched The Wild Bunch today and found myself a little perplexed. Overall, I enjoyed the film, but like many older movies, it feels somewhat dated in certain aspects. That said, its strengths—particularly in performance, cinematography, and its influence on the western genre—are **** cast delivers strong performances, with William Holden and Ernest Borgnine standing out. They seem tailor-made for Peckinpah’s brutal, unflinching world, embodying aging outlaws clinging to a violent way of life that is quickly fading. Supporting actors, including western stalwarts like Strother Martin, help bridge the gap between traditional westerns and the darker, more cynical vision Peckinpah **** its time, The Wild Bunch must have been revolutionary. Peckinpah didn’t just push boundaries—he bulldozed them, ushering American cinema into a new era of violence, moral ambiguity, and overt sexism that would become hallmarks of 1970s filmmaking. The film’s balletic bloodshed, especially in its infamous slow-motion shootouts, would go on to influence everything from The Godfather to Reservoir **** cinematography is another highlight. Peckinpah crafts a world that feels expansive yet claustrophobic, using large sets and hordes of extras to heighten the chaos. Instead of the sweeping Monument Valley vistas of a John Ford western, he fills the screen with dust, grime, and heat, making the environment feel as unforgiving as the characters themselves.Upon release, The Wild Bunch was met with controversy due to its extreme violence, shocking even in an era that had already seen Bonnie and Clyde push the envelope. Critics were divided—some saw it as a masterpiece of revisionist western filmmaking, while others condemned it as nihilistic and excessive. However, audiences responded well, and the film performed respectably at the box office. Over time, its reputation has only grown. What was once shocking is now seen as groundbreaking, and Peckinpah’s vision has been re-evaluated as one of the most important films in American cinema.While The Wild Bunch may feel dated in some respects, it remains an essential and fascinating piece of film history—a movie that not only redefined the western but also left a lasting mark on the industry as a whole.",DasBurper

In fact, I'm comfortable saying that the opening and closing gunfights in this are absolutely perfect. Damn near everything between them, however, pales in comparison. I just couldn't find anything to latch on to when it came to these characters, save for maybe Ernest Borgnine's ""Dutch Engstrom,"" probably the only stand-up guy in the whole picture.

The other problem, of course, is that the protagonists are all bad guys. They're not antiheros. You need to have some redeeming characteristics to qualify as an antihero. And if you're going to carry a movie you need some redeeming characteristics. Don Corleone had his family ""honor."" Tommy DeVito made for a funny psycho. William Holden and company are all fine actors, but their characters are dry as dust and we the audience are supposed to sympathize because they're ageing out of the outlaw business and the times they are a-changing. So never mind that they shoot up a bunch of civilians and a bunch of fellas from the US Army. Never mind that they shoot up a bunch of guys from the army of Mexico. We're supposed to go along with this. And, sorry, but I ain't buying.

8.3,10,Citizen Kane,"SEP 2, 2025","It’s tough to fairly critique a movie so widely lauded as one of the greats. How does one watch The Godfather with an open mind after fifty years of critical pressure? That goes double for Citizen Kane, given its additional age and notoriety. Older movies can be hard to contextualize, even for those already well-versed in the era’s cinematic language. In 1941, Hollywood had only been making talkies for a few years. For Kane, though, I actually see this elder status as a benefit: it does more than just hold up, it holds its own. Eight decades later, Orson Welles’s ambitious debut remains engaging and easy to watch, even by modern standards. There’s just something about a well-crafted story, told with care and conviction, that never goes out of style. Its plot is colorful and alluring, stuffed with dynamic, rounded characters. Its artistry is sharp and daring, richly designed and strikingly photographed. Each frame is deeply considered and imbued with meaning. There’s similar fire and passion in nearly every element. The big cast of stage veterans, eager to prove their worth on the screen. The iconography, expertly crafted and larger than life. The lingering mystery of “Rosebud,” befuddling and powerful as a story mover and rewarding as a final revelation. Welles has lined everything up just-so, an intricate web of large acts and small tells that come together to weave an irresistible saga. Citizen Kane’s framing device works extraordinarily well, dispensing a street-smart journalist to puzzle over a magnate’s last words while sifting through the spoken record to paint an outline of his life. He segues from one interview to another, capturing snippets of the man’s character from all angles, before finally arriving at the conclusion that no single word, no matter how enigmatic, could possibly explain a life so thoroughly lived. He’s completely wrong on that count. “Rosebud” speaks volumes about this man: his desperation to be admired and loved; his refusal to really open himself up in pursuit of those goals; his tireless efforts to meet an impossible expectation; his sharp dismissal of anyone who dares challenge his ideals. Unfortunately for our weary newsman, no living soul remains to express these nuances, nor to connect them to the word in question. Without that context, its origins mean nothing. Charles Foster Kane left plenty of observers in his wake - spurned comrades, embittered lovers, jaded employees, jealous observers - but the man they describe is only a projection. The image he wished the world to see, not the one which dwelt beneath the steely shell. That’s a relatively simple story, really. The man who seemingly has everything, overcompensating to satisfy an urge that most of us would take for granted. Welles adds cinematic flourishes, draws magnificent performances from his cast (including himself) and spices it with a tantalizing secret, but this wouldn’t be recognized as such a landmark achievement if that main arc weren’t so well-realized, recognizable and effective. Put it all together? Yeah, that’s deserving of all-timer status. A masterpiece of film.",drqshadow

Es innovador sin duda, pero yo creo que la historia no se siente cercana, y con esto me refiero a que, si bien la temática es interesante con respecto a la evolución del personaje principal, desde un niño hasta convertirse en la persona con más poder en el país hasta sus incontables fracasos que lo llevaron a, de cierta forma, aislarse del mundo exterior, y el final interesante que se refiere a esa búsqueda de muchos de nosotros por ser niños otra vez, que recordamos épocas anteriores en las que no pudimos vivir, se vuelve una búsqueda incesante de buscarla incluso hasta volverse tóxico.

So get right to the point, without any introductions. Does this film deserve a place in the list of ""250 audience ratings""/""Must See""? No. Does this film deserve a place in the pantheon of masterworks that have had a significant impact on cinema? Yes. I think it's stupid to give a film a high rating based only on how many innovative and significant ideas were used in it. The average viewer is primarily interested in the story and the quality of its implementation, rather than the ""play of light"" and ""shooting angle."" In my opinion, the objective weight of many ""enthusiastic"" reviews (10/10) is as low as the unfounded 1/1 (0/0) that are given to other films or games. It's time for aggregators and viewers to keep up with the times and change. All ""Tops"" need to be updated, not patronized, calling it a ""weighted system."" Perhaps the best solution would be to divide the tops by time-relevance or into purely viewer and professional ones.

8.3,8,Citizen Kane,"DEC 29, 2021","I will write this review thanks to what I noticed for myself, as a casual movie watcher, inclined to grasp the few details that my knowledge allows me to grasp : Welles did an amazing job with the use of a certain type of cameras that I simply can't name as it permits us to catch the many informations given through the image. There are numerous impressive movements and details caught by the camera that lead us to draw particualr conclusions about both the characters and the scenes they are producing. The work of lights and shadows is highly interesting : this gave birth to gorgeous sequences and unavoidable effects on protagonists. Overall (and with a few exceptions), the actors' performances are terrific, especially Welles'. Backgrounds and environments are skillfully set up. It is like if I could see the colours of it behind their white-black-grey textures. Characters' last words are really meaningful and give the story more beauty. The story is interesting but I often had the impression that I didn't know where the film was going. We see the investigation going on and on and have no clue for what seems hours and hours. This contributes to give to 'Citizen Kane' the 'boring' side many people find in it. However I must admit that the narrative (helped by cross-fades and flashbacks used with mastery) is really surprising. Its length and the precipitation of the ending were two other features I would identify as 'flaws'. If the last manages to close the movie on a poetic side, I couldn't help but think 'all for this only ? Really ?' One last defect is that I found the film repeats itself a bit too much. Characters aswer many things we already know, and even the camera shows informations we already possessed. Eventually it is an interesting American 'success' story : don't hope to see and hear anything else than the so-called never-equaled beauty of the dreamland of the United States of America.

8.3,2,Citizen Kane,"MAR 22, 2021","I can’t believe this movie has anywhere near the score it does on all of these critic platforms. This movie was the biggest steaming pile of s*** I’ve ever watched in my entire life. Horrible acting and story flow make it nearly unwatchable. I get that it was released in 1941. I get that. It was one of the first of its kind, ok, I understand. But that alone shouldn’t rescue it from all of its faults. I’m sure there are plenty of artistes who went to film school and have been told of this movie’s greatness and all the reasons why it is a masterpiece. Then they regurgitate that line to the next generation, and this lie keeps perpetuating through the ages. But this film should be judged for what it is. It seems impossible to me that this rating should be anywhere near 100%. People are either lying to themselves or trying to be part of the artiste bandwagon. I’m sure that in the film world, if you don’t like Cotizen Kane, then you’re some sort of country bumpkin, philistine ding dong who just can’t understand the underlying qualities that make this picture so divinely exquisite. But anyone who comes back down to earth for 2 hours will see this movie for what it is: a bold accomplishment in early filmmaking that, when viewed in its historical context, can be appreciated for the boundaries it pushed and trails it blazed for films that came after, but that it is simultaneously a steaming pile of s*** of a film that borders on unwatchably bad.",seaning

'Citizen Kane', at least to me, feels like such a unique film in terms of how it is brought to life - I don't recall seeing anything that exactly matches it in that regard. It's thoroughly entertaining, I do love how it is crafted together. The score is terrific and the performances from the cast are excellent. Orson Welles, the director too of course, is perfect for the titular role. He is sensational, it must be said. He makes Charles Foster Kane absolutely fascinating, despite the questionable nature of the character. I basically enjoyed everyone else who came onscreen, the more memorable ones being Joseph Cotten (Jedediah) and Dorothy Comingore (Susan) - George Coulouris (Thatcher) has a few amusing moments, also. The editing and pacing are two other things that impressed me, as did the fantastic News on the March opening. This is one of those films that I've heard about for as long as I can remember, so I'm glad to finally get it watched - added to the fact it didn't disappoint.",r96sk

It is understandably difficult to have an overarching theme when trying portray the life and struggles of an adolescent boy. That is perhaps why this particular film seemed to wander significantly.

Certainly filming the same children for 12 years is a neat **** its still a gimmick. The rest of the film surrounding that gimmick is really nothing all that special. The acting is okay. Cinematography is pedestrian. The screenplay is pedestrian. The story of growing up presented here itself is not very compelling. Sorry to say but the child actors here really were very bad at acting (not that that could have been foreseen when they started). The only really neat or special part of this movie is watching the children age as the film progresses, which does not by itself make it deserving of a perfect score for film-making all time.

En eso ayuda mucho el trasfondo de guerra. El final es bastante satisfactorio e inclusive sorprendente por el giro de guion que existe. Y también quiero referirme a la escena que más resonó en mí, y es: ¿puede alguien considerar 'traición' si por esa acción puede ayudar a los demás? Creo que la respuesta dependerá de la situación y las personas involucradas; en mi caso es no. Y justo por eso, la aventura que tiene nuestro protagonista con la mujer me dejó un mal sabor de boca, por ella claro, ya que realmente no fue sincera.

I honestly don't care that it's an old film, I personally think that's not a convincing enough excuse for hating a film as wonderful as this , because you are seriously missing out, if you haven't seen it. The cinematography is just fantastic, with clever brooding camera-work. The music by Max Steiner is outstanding, from the sweeping haunting love theme As Time Goes By, to the excerpts of the french national anthem. The scene where everyone starts singing in the café was extraordinary and one of the many highlights of the film. The screenplay is unquestionably one of the finest in the history of cinema, right up there with Shawshank Redemption and All About Eve, containing great memorable lines such as ""seems as though Destiny is at hand"". The performances were superlative, Humphrey Bogart giving one of cinema's greatest lead performances as the ""cynical sentimentalist"" Rick Blain. Also superb are Ingrid Bergman who positively lights up the screen as Ilsa, the young woman who breaks his heart, Paul Henreid as the fugitive husband, and Claude Rains as Captain Renault. The plot is a little complicated, but I couldn't help being impressed with the performances and the screenplay. Not to mention a timeless love story that I don't think has ever been topped. Overall, a masterpiece, that quite rightly received an academy award for best picture. 10/10 Bethany Cox",kyle20ellis

Right from the beginning it throws so much at you that it is hard to keep up, and the story goes in so many unexpected directions. There are a ton of characters, and yet somehow, every one of them, with the exception of the ****, won me over. This movie is super heavy on dialog, but unlike modern cinema where characters talk just to fill time, the dialog in “Casablanca” feels like it is all in support of the plot, which forces you to hang on every word or else you will get lost.

8.7,8,Casablanca,"MAY 19, 2019","Bogart and Bergman are changing history, witness it now or a century later, something so pure as such, doesn't get rusty. Casablanca Curtiz is light on his feet and smooth as the Jazz that is continuously and melodiously played in the hotel. And I think it is his supervision that blends in sacrifice in romance, so pure and irreplaceable, that drama is overshadowed by its crowd pleasing concept. The director, Michael Curtiz installs tiny notions in the script that carves a momentum of live hotel and the do's and don'ts of a hotelier especially the magnetic reputation he or she juggles by dipping his or her hands on both the side of the dirt. The Robin Hood figure, is their way in, and with Humphrey Bogart playing one of the most iconic character, the first act of the film is building up his figure that is latter to be **** with such fragility. But the final act is brimmed with charm, so where they actually had to work was the introduction. And choreographed like some exotic dance, the entire hotel that is mapped out in front of us, makes us feel like home something that has aged well over the years. Personally, I prefer the sacrifice of his hotel's fairness regarding the gambling policies. To me, that would always be the game changer, not only the actress's performance but the tone that shifts with such calculative baby steps that you are sinking in deliberately in those twinkling eyes. And if Bogart is boasting off with some of his best work then Ingrid Bergman definitely casts the magic powerful enough to rubble him down in a blink. Their equation is like some wine, you are buzzed with the aftermath soberness rather than their poetic romantic vacation. Casablanca defines the Hollywood version of Americana set in a different location, it was ahead of its time then and it is now; all hail the classic dish serving one purpose and one only.",amheretojudge

This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie many times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again. Rewatching it recently on 4K UHD disk kinda blew me away the fact of how incredible it looks. There isn't anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn't said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level. Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it's a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art. Overall, because you have probably already seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while.

9.2,10,The Godfather,"SEP 25, 2024","The mafia epic to which all others are measured. Maybe even the greatest film of all time, but I don't think that's a fair judgment to cast. In either case, Francis Coppola's much-heralded masterwork, jumbo-sized but not without good reason, still delivers. The Godfather's sheer ambition is a sight to behold, packed with strong characters, complicated choices, bitter curves and a grand, decades-spanning arc. It's as close as cinema has ever come to matching the rich, chewy abundance **** novel, even if it does skim a few years in the third act. We're treated to layers upon layers of comprehensively-defined individuals, even the ancillary roles, with a strikingly complex dynasty at the center of it all. The Corleones are a crucially diverse group, distinct but also alike, and fundamentally familiar despite the off-putting nature of the family business. Sonny, the hot-headed heir apparent; Fredo, the kowtowed black sheep; Vito, the rational, well-composed patriarch; Michael, the intellectual firebrand with lofty ideals. In retrospect, their paths are obvious, but in the heat of the moment we're shocked by every twist of the knife. Moments of deep contemplation contrast with explosions of spontaneous violence, loud illustrations of the literal dog-eat-dog nature of this particular line of work. Coppola wrangles everything like the illustrated puppet master depicted in the franchise logo. It's all precisely orchestrated, timed for peak efficiency, yet somehow never grows formulaic or loses touch with its essentially human, organic pulse. Not a wasted movement, nor a missed opportunity. What an achievement, just to complete a film of this magnitude.

If the previous ones depicted the ideologies of the aftermath of catastrophic events and a subjective procedure of how to survive them, this one at least grabs your attention with a lighter perspective. Nevertheless, the gist remains the same, the method is more subtle and complex than the previous ones. This one is made to make you sweat on your seat. It demands you to be on the edge of your seat. It is a tale that makes you think. The argumentative conversation, morally complex situation and ethically challenged solutions, this one is much more talkative and yet is still inexpressive than any of its chapter. It is way too layered and mature than we usually get. This final death sentence of the trilogy, is a remarkable revelations on terms of storytelling. Kieslowski has much more Shakespeare in him than it comes off. He takes those same emotion and impute them at different situations and different characters, and projects the range and parallel nature of that single emotion. The narrative is adaptive and layered with sharp conversations that amps up the charge to a whole new level. There is more ruggedness in here, despite of it not being that sinister and dark than its previous chapters. It stands alone in the entire trilogy. This one is brighter and sweeter, it doesn't demand attention, it just keeps pulling you back in with its unstoppable force. Trintignant is a threat on screen, he can be mean as a street but his nurturing is quite mellow. His ideologies are off track and yet sane than most of the characters.

A true epic, from the breath-stealing long shots of an unimaginably vast desert to the explosive, well-outfitted battle scenes, it lives up to the billing and then some. I was mesmerized by the photography in particular, which constantly discovers new ways to portray what could have been a rather redundant, flat, boring landscape. Truly beautiful, almost ruminative at times, with an appreciation for the artisanship of film. As for the plot, well... it's a bit slow. Particularly so in the nearly four-hour director's cut, which feels completely unnecessary. I've never seen the theatrical release, which is noted for being incomprehensible in places due to the awkward cuts, but it seems suspicious that half an hour or more couldn't have been lopped off somewhere to improve the pace. Lawrence of Arabia is an exhausting watch, and not just because of the draining personal transformation we see in the title character. There's good material, of course, plenty of it. The hopeless inner squabble of an Arab population that's desperately close to the unified independence they seek. The protagonist's progression from philosophical humanist to enraged berzerker to **** shell. We get plenty to think about, long after the credits have finally, mercifully rolled, but it's a marathon to reach that point.

The spectacularly gorgeous and awe inspiring cinematography of Freddie Young tips the scale for me in favor of 'Lawrence Of Arabia' as Film's greatest work of art in the Epic genre, and surpasses 'Citizen Kane', and The 'Shawshank Redemption’, landing at #3 on my lMDb ""Top 5 Greatest Films"" ever made list, topped only by 'The Godfather' (#1) and 'Spotlight' (which moved up to #2 all-time in its first year of eligibility in 2020). The immensity and scale of the desert creates the perfect canvas on which Lean paints his masterpiece - We shall never again see authentic location shoots on this truly epic scale, as granted permission for such is virtually impossible today (one reason why films are shot in similar locals around the world, but often not the actually location where the story takes place). Restoration efforts in 1988 led by Spielberg and Scorsese saved most of what would have been a tragic loss. Now available in 4K UHD, the film has never looked better.

8.5,10,Lawrence of Arabia (re-release),"MAR 1, 2021","My score 100/100 Sweeping, epic and literate version of British adventurer and soldier T E Lawrence's experiences in Arabia during the First World War. Lawrence, miraculously well played by Peter O'Toole, ""went native"" when sent into the desert to find Alec Guinness's Prince Feisal. Before long he was striking out himself against the Turkish Ottoman Empire, which still held sway in the region at the beginning of the last century. Lawrence's efforts to unify the various Arab factions are particularly prescient. Lawrence became an inspirational warlord whose neutral presence amongst the Arab tribes, lead by Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn, amongst others, served to glue together shifting and uneasy alliances. As well as wrestling with himself, with his own demons, and with the cruel desert environment, the Englishman was also faced with culture clashes which pitted not only the imperialists against the indigenous populations, but also the mercenary practices of the Arab guerillas against the discipline of the British army. In the end, Lawrence himself does not know which side he is on, nor which party he belongs to. Set against a backdrop of the Arabian desert, the nomadic allies under Lawrence's direction, attack and disrupt the Turks' efforts to maintain control of the territory, whilst the elephant - the British army and its heavy guns under General Jack Hawkins - pushes ever deeper into the area: not until his job is done does Lawrence learn that the French and British governments have carved up the middle-east between them and that the battle-lines for the 21st century are already being drawn. Scripted by the inimitable Robert Bolt and directed by David Lean, Lawrence of Arabia is one of those films without a weakness, despite drawing complaints for its near four hour length. The dialogue, cinematography, soundtrack and especially direction are superlative; likewise the supporting actors. But it is O'Toole at his charismatic best who steals the show in his starring debut; he never looked back. It may take an effort to watch this movie, but is well worth the ride and will, by the bye, provide some insight into the fractious and volatile world of Arab politics.

8.5,9,Lawrence of Arabia (re-release),"FEB 21, 2019","000First and foremost, this movie has way more humor than I ever thought it would have. From its very beginning, I was quite surprised by the amount of humor I found, not only because I didn't expect so, but also because it often works pretty well! Another great surprise I had watching this movie is that I didn't find it boring at all despite its nearly four-hours runtime. A long runtime alone doesn't make a movie bad or weak, but it certainly doesn't help. But I really think there is almost no second that David Lean has wasted in this textbook example of epic cinema. It's quite entertaining for plenty of reasons; two of them are the fascinating cinematography that treated my eyes with some of the most jaw-dropping images I've ever seen been captured on film, and the mind-bogglingly masterful editing that is easily also one of the best I've ever seen in film. Lawrence of Arabia is also surprisingly very simple despite its fiendishly complex portrait of the titular character. Actually it may be sometimes too simple for its own good, for I think the movie became superficial and shallow at the beginning of its second half for the sake of nothing but developing the character of Lawrence. There are some key events that should have been more focused on, but ended up being demonstrated comparatively quite fast and superficially. That made the second half a bit muddled, unlike the unbelievably perfect first half, but this wasn't much of an issue for me; because David Lean really make up for this simplicity by delivering a disturbing, terrifying, opulent, astute and utterly unique psychological profile of a heroic, yet flawed historical figure that is the protagonist, Lawrence. As for Peter O'Toole's performance, the only thing I could say is that I was quite mad for about the first half of the movie because how inaccurately serious-looking he appeared on the poster of the movie despite the fact he was rather good-natured, and looked quite charming. Of course, I realized that I was embarrassingly wrong when O'Toole gradually changed 100 percent to a very serious, and even seemingly mad man who struggles to find a balance in his life,nay, to discover his identity. I also want to say that I'm so so proud of Omar Sharif, who brought one of the most iconic secondary characters in the history of cinema! Alec Guinness was also terrific as Prince Faisal, although I still think he delivered his best performance in The Bridge on the River Kwai, another epic from Lean. Auda Abu Tayi is one of the most blatantly greedy characters I've seen in film, and it could have never been portrayed so convincingly by other than the great actor, Anthony Quinn.

8.5,10,Lawrence of Arabia (re-release),"MAR 18, 2018","This film tells an important part of T. E. Lawrence's life. A curious and highly intelligent man, joined the British Army during First World War and had a decisive role in the Arab Revolt of 1916 against the Turks. Directed by David Lean and scripted by Robert Bolt, it has the participation of Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif. T. E. Lawrence is one of the most interesting characters of the First World War. It wasn't a brilliant general or military, but got a huge part along the Arab tribes, disunited and often rivals, making them a highly effective troop (despite being composed of irregular militias). The film shows us how he got it and the price he paid (the scenes of violence when he was imprisoned by the Turks, although softened, can still suggest the alleged anal **** that he have suffered, among other tortures). The film is full of stunning scenes of the desert and is visually appealing, perhaps one of the epic films that gave greater attention to the use of natural landscapes to impress the public. The harshness of living conditions (or rather, survival) of the local tribes is also depicted with objectivity, as well as the importance given to water and control of wells. The action scenes were well thought out and show how the struggle was unequal, apparently doomed to failure (the Arabs battled with archaic methods and weapons, when compared to those used by Turks). The performance of the actors is something exceptional. The film is full of great players who have been at their best. Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif stand out naturally by the exceptional quality of their work, in a film that has become largely responsible for their consecration. The costumes are also excellent and, at least to me, seem consistent with the kind of clothes and uniforms depicted in photographs of the time, a sign **** historical consulting work.

8.5,5,Lawrence of Arabia (re-release),"SEP 20, 2017","A 'movie' I recommend, but notice I give it only 5/10. You should not expect an adventure story as many sites list it, instead you will find the rest are true; a Biography War Drama. A perfect comparison to this story is the movie: 'The Ten Commandments'. An extremely long look at a piece of history. This film fails as a solely entertaining experience. If you do not want to know this piece of (biased)history then don't watch this movie. I watched this because it was voted top Adventure movie in many places, but I would not call this an adventure, more a biography as stated before. There is no structure to make this an interesting and exciting story, just a historical retelling with only its events as pacing, making it slow and unsuspenseful. It certainly didn't need the extra hour and a half it took, but lacking any structure they decided to show everything they had and cut nothing. Overall I liked the movie despite the score, but it certainly is no adventure movie or anything worth 3 and a half hours unless you're into movies like the ten commandments. Look to other movies for entertainment, especially in the adventure category.",HiddenAce

8.5,3,Lawrence of Arabia (re-release),"OCT 7, 2016","I found out one very interesting fact about this film users review is ""CONSISTENCY"" ... all the negative critics users written are very very similar like: - film too long (3.50h) - film too boring - film has poor story The users which gave negative critics also pointed out some positive thing found in the film similar like: - film has great photography (desert scenes/animal scenes camels, horses...) - film has some great acting performances (but boring story and very long scenes spoiled my interest) MY CONCLUSION: Like the most of the negative user critics I had very similar experience. I was actually very disappointed because I've read so many good critics from users before I watched this film all saying it is EPIC film but as I watched it -> partially/fully overrated... It deserves only three stars and no more. I shoul next time read aso the negative critics before reading positive to see the difference. But likely the critics which are many places consistent and repetitive are likely ""genuine critics"" or real personal experience. Im not sure if all this positive critics found on board are ""truly genuine critics"" because film making is big money today much bigger then before we are talking of billions of $$$...so what to think... I learn every time something new... one has to seems read also the negative comments/ratings and if there is consistency there is great chance of genuine viewers experience it means I may also not like this film.... chances are 50-70%....",virtualPresence

8.5,10,Lawrence of Arabia (re-release),"OCT 22, 2015","Lawrence of Arabia is a classicist Epic directed by David Lean, and starring Peter O’Toole as the titular character T.E. Lawrence. In many ways Lawrence of Arabia exemplifies an Epic, but what may be most impressive about the film is it’s use of character development and themes. Lawrence of Arabia may be the best epic of all time, because it is grand in scope, long but never boring, and beautiful to look at. It truly is a masterpiece. When one thinks of what defines an epic, they could point to Lawrence of Arabia as a perfect example, it literally sets the standard. For example Lawrence of Arabia contains many Extreme Wide Shots of a vast panoramic landscape, this is one of the most recognizable elements of a epic, reinforcing how large in scope the story is. Most epics deal with stories that have a sense of spectacle, and therefore use these huge landscapes to show that, Lawrence of Arabia does that as well as any other film. Set against the Arabic dessert, which lends itself to large panoramic landscape shots, the audience is treated to seeing a beautiful picture, and in the middle we see these characters trying to navigate their way through it all. The film liked to use mostly wide shots, so much so that when they use a close up, it truly feels like it has meaning. On top of that Lawrence of Arabia contains some of the most luxurious set designs, and costumes of the time. High production values is of course is another common element of an epic, but the most impressive thing about Lawrence of Arabia is the pacing and the character development. At almost four hours it’s hard to imagine a film that wouldn’t feel long, but somehow Lawrence of Arabia manages not to. This is most likely because the themes and characters are both relatable, but also larger than life in some ways. Seeing a normal man navigate his way through massive desserts, and through foreign cultures may make him seem larger than life, but to his core the film keeps Lawrence human, so the audience never feels detached from him. The film deals with age old themes such as the “fish out of water” theme, which is used quite often, but arguably never better than in this film. As with most of the best films, the story and character development is mostly visual. In the beginning we quickly see how out of place Lawrence is, as we see his Arab escort shot for stealing water, Lawrence is outraged, as to him killing is taboo, and water is a common commodity, yet to the arab culture, Water is so precious it’s worth killing for. As the film goes on Lawrence learns the cultural difference, and learns not to treat other cultures as barbaric, because to them he is the barbarian. Utilizing beautiful grandeur Lawrence of Arabia still stands as one of, the best epics of all time, and a true masterpiece of cinema. Embodying all of the characteristics of a classic epic film Lawrence of Arabia is truly impressive because of it’s masterful pacing and character development. It truly is an epic experience.",tjman09
8.5,10,Lawrence of Arabia (re-release),"JUL 26, 2015","Whenever the word ""desert"" comes to mind, most people think of it as, hot, boring, sandy. All terms that are true in the desert and is one place you never want to be. ""Lawrence of Arabia"" proves to be a historical masterpiece in cinema, that won seven oscars including best motion picture of 1962. History is a big part of ""Lawrence of Arabia"", as it follows the controversial leader known as T.E Lawrence (played by Peter O'Toole). The film is very much accurate following the Brits and Arabs fighting against the Turks in the early 20th century. Very well portrayed and executed, the film has everything you would expect from a historical movie, being entertaining to watch every minute. The film starts out with one of the most beautiful musical scores ever composed. We are introduced to the movie hearing an original musical score for six minutes until the movie fully begins. The score is epic, funny, and enjoyable as you wait for the movie to begin. We then see a man riding on a motorcycle, he is not in the desert, but in England. The scene then transitions to a historical sight in another part of England remembering the battle of Arabia. T.E Lawrence sets out to find the prince (played by Alec Guinness) to help him fight the Turks during the World War I era in the early 20th century. He is set out by the Brits to go and find him, many new characters are introduced along the way, such as Sharif Ali (played by Omar Sharif), and Auda Abu (played by Anthony Quinn). The best thing about the characters, they all have something to do with the plot, not just to be thrown in there to be extras. The setting is like no other, taken place in the Arabian desert, the setting makes the adaptation of the film unique. The award winning cinematography made the film as great as it is and beautiful to look at. The costumes fit with the story of the film as all the Arabs look like the way they the used to look like. Overall, ""Lawremce of Arabia"" is a classic masterpiece. The film truly deserved the best picture award, and without a doubt, this is my favorite movie of all time. There is no other film I have seen that could top this one. Simply memorable by all the performances and classic scenes, this one os worth a go.",30Cents
8.5,10,Lawrence of Arabia (re-release),"APR 29, 2015","The historical epic has been a staple of the motion picture industry since the silent era. Over the years, it has evolved to mesh with the times and meet audiences' expectations. Viewers in the 1910s got D.W. Griffith's racist Birth of a Nation, while movie-goers in the 2000s were poleaxed by the trite but visually impressive Pearl Harbor. In between lie the best of the epics, and, while it's impossible to single out one as being at the inarguable top of the heap, David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia is certainly a contender for the position. Riveting from beginning to end, featuring stellar performances, amazing cinematography, and a story without a trace of fat, the film does everything an epic is supposed to do - and more. Lawrence of Arabia recounts the larger-than-life exploits of T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), an officer in the British army serving in the Middle East during World War I, who, according to one observer, ""was a poet, a scholar, and a mighty warrior. He was also the most shameless exhibitionist since Barnum & Bailey."" The film opens in 1935, with a prologue that shows Lawrence's death as a result of a motorcycle accident, followed by his funeral. The time frame then shifts back more than 20 years to Cairo, where Lawrence is about to begin the greatest adventure of his career. His commanding officer orders him to enter the desert and make contact with the Bedouin Prince Feisel (Alec Guiness), who is a British ally in the fight against the Turks. What follows is not only an account of how Lawrence became a pivotal figure in the Arab revolt against the Turks, but of the nearly-Shakespearean rise and fall of his character. The director's cut runs a little over 3 1/2 hours, and every moment seems necessary. The pacing is tight - there's plenty of action and adventure interspersed with character development, plot exposition, and majestic visuals. Therefore, it's hard to believe that a theatrical version exists in which more than 30 minutes of material was excised. Indeed, most people who saw this film during the 1960s and 1970s weren't getting the entire picture (although Lean was involved in the trimming done to create the 3 1/4 hour print widely seen in U.S. theaters and the 3-hour version shown on television). Fortunately, in the late-80s, the original edition of Lawrence of Arabia was painstakingly restored (with the participation of David Lean and the surviving actors). The restoration was handled so expertly that, watching the new print, it's virtually impossible to see the shifts in visual acuity that often mark the inclusion of previously-eliminated scenes. The most compelling aspect of Lawrence of Arabia is the way in which it dissects the fluid, often-contradictory personality of the title character. Like many of the best classic ""war"" movies (such as Patton), this one uses the battles as a backdrop for a character study. The combat sequences in Lawrence of Arabia are perfunctory, with few of the details shown. This allows us to focus on the individual at the epicenter of the storm. When we first meet him, Lawrence is an oddball craving a mission in the desert (calling it ""fun""), something that his fellows shun. After spending some time with the Arabs and being asked why he likes the desert, he has a simple answer: ""It's clean"". The movie explores Lawrence's friendship with Sherif Ali, and shows how the Arabs willingly adopt him as their leader, even though he has white skin. But Lawrence's psyche suffers a severe blow after his torture at the hands of the Turks. Initially, he is unwilling to return to the desert, but, when commanded to do so, he comes back driven by a newfound lust for killing and a desire for revenge. His final mission - the capture of Damascus - shows Lawrence's dark side. There is one visual oddity associated with the manner in which Lawrence of Arabia was filmed. Because it was not possible to shoot the night scenes at night, they were lensed during the day using light-damping filters. So, while it looks like night, the camels and horses cast noticeable shadows. Today, computers would be used to digitally erase these anomalies (then again, today, the filming could be done after dark), but their existence in Lawrence of Arabia adds a certain otherworldliness to those scenes in which the ""night-shadows"" appear. For David Lean, widely regarded as one of the masters of epic filmmaking, Lawrence of Arabia represented the most ambitious undertaking of a fruitful career. Restored to its full length in 1989, the version available today shows the story as Lean intended it to be seen - provided the viewer is able to see it projected, not compressed onto a TV screen. While it's true that Lawrence of Arabia still works on the small screen, it is robbed of one of the most important aspect of any motion picture spectacle - the awe factor. When that is present, this becomes an event - something that even the most restless viewer will become lost in.",CineFiles

8.5,10,Lawrence of Arabia (re-release),"JUN 7, 2013","Whether it is the stunning visual landscape that enthrals the entire film, the literary genius of the writing or the larger than life and superior acting of the cast involved, Lawrence of Arabia can stand among the rest as one of the greatest films, art or whatever else, to ever be created. Peter O'Toole puts in not only the finest performance of his career to date, but one of the finest and emotionally driven of any performance seen in cinema, portraying T.E. Lawrence in his debut is no menial task, but captured through his calm and collective speech, his arrogance for command and his undying will to succeed where most believed impossible is achieved impeccably on numerous occasions from O'Toole. Lawrence, a British Army Lieutenant and very much out of place in his position, is assigned to assess the intentions of Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) in his struggle against the Turks. Upon eventually meeting the Prince, Lawrence's constant interruptions of his General intrigues the Prince, who then lets Lawrence carry out his own mission of a sneak attack on Aqaba, a Turk-fortified city. As Lawrence earns the respect amongst his combatants, he soon finds himself as a sort of God amongst men, they would kill for him and also die for him. The score from start to finish immediately solidifies what this film is doing, creating and building an epic story, character driven and thoughtful masterpiece to cement a legacy not only for the man it follows, but for its own reputation as a film, and a film it is. A more beautiful and stunning film is rare to see without countless special effects, yet Lawrence of Arabia uses something that is seen as nothing, the desert, and completely obliterates any of the concerned. When films like this are viewed on an imaginative and respected level, its difficult not feel very different than you were before watching them, much like Apocalypse Now and others, Lawrence of Arabia gives you something that you may not have ever witnessed before, and probably won't witness again, the effort of the film, the stunning visuals and the literary brilliance of the writing, especially for the wonderful Peter O'Toole, along with Omar Sharif, many moments of screen time are given to O'Toole, and with his piercing blue eyes its hard to look away for whatever reason. Take it from a fan, you will never see another film quite like this, best films lists or not, this is what a masterful film is all about, big and bold on every scale, never holding back its potential and delivering a powerhouse feature that lives on fifty years later, you owe it as a film fan to watch and be amazed.",StevenF

It was in the top 10 of the AFI top 100 movies of all time, and it had received many 4 star reviews. About an hour into the film, I fell asleep. Now, fans of the film would say, ""Oh, you can't handle the impact of a long epic film. You have a short attention span."" Well, with me, that is not the case. But, on the subject of length, this film is almost four hours long. For the content displayed in this film, the running time was way too long. If Titanic can cram all the hefty things it needed in a matter of 3 hours, then this is no excuse. Nothing was happening. I mean, literally nothing. The screenplay needs a real doctor, because it has so much unneeded dialogue. It just procrastinated its way through, I think because it really had nothing more interesting. Director David lean is probably one of the best directors of all time, but in this film, you can tell that his and the producer's mind frame was ""I wonder how many academy awards I can get through this film?"" It wasn't made naturally, it was gargantuan for this point. I about turned off the movie when I saw a thirty second look at the desert landscape for about the millionth time. Yes, it does take place in the desert, but this movie was called ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" not ""The Arabian Desert."" Which brings me to my next point: Peter O' Toole. I have seen him in many marvelous performances. I'm surprised he hasn't received an Oscar yet. But, his interpretation of Lawrence was so vague. You only saw the exterior, you never saw the interior. He gets a rush out of killing, yet we don't know why. i partially blame it on the script writers, but I also partially blame it on him. When you are an actor, you have to convey to the audience who you are, no matter how good or bad the script is. he is playing the character that embodies the whole movie. It is solely about him, and he doesn't sell that. Now, I'm not going to bash everything just because I don't like the film, but i will compliment Alec Guinness for his outstanding but short performance as Prince Feisal, Maurice Jarre for the superb score, and the editing. Sorry to burst the bubble of the ""Lawrence of Arabia"" fans, but I really think this film is overrated, and that it is not as good as it is made out to be.
