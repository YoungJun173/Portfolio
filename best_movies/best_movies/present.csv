7.4,10,Dekalog (1988),"OCT 31, 2024","For me it is simply breathtaking what a tv series the dekalog is, I know it is classified as a movie but it really is a series consisting of 10 episodes. By far THE GOAT, no questions, THE GREATEST TV SHOW THAT WILL EVER GRACE THIS PLANET, please watch it. Sopranos does not scratch it, not the wire game of thrones or any **** thatyou might think is good like breaking bad, dexter, the boys, band of brothers, mad men. Utter **** when compared to this and utter **** in general except for band of brothers. How is it possible that a tv show with actors you have never heard of can get compared with great films. Usually if you know films you have an understanding that whatever the best tv show oat is, for an example the wire, it probably is worse than catch me if you can, a movie that doesn't come close to top 100. But oh my **** god, Ksistof you **** did it. I AM AN ATHEIST FOR **** SAKE, THIS SERIES IS CENTERED AROUND CHRISTIANITY, the dekalog will changeyour life if you understand it. The way it manages to critique society is unbelivable and I can only compare it to se7en, my favorite movie. But my god, is it a peice of art. If you are into stories or characters go ahead and watch **** fiction that you can binge and be happy and talk to your friends about who killed who, who kissed who or who betrayed who, but if you want to learn something about life and experience an art form that will change your life try to understamd the decalogue and watch THE GOAT of TV the dekalog. Please. When you include fiction and that means films, movies, tv shows and books, dekalog is top 10 for me, a masterpiece.",Daki1105

7.4,10,Dekalog (1988),"MAY 1, 2021","The best 10 hours you will spend at movies and this Series. Ten commandments. 10 episodes. 10 hours. When it first aired on Polish television in 1989, decades before long-form filmmaking would come to be regarded as the last bastion of auteurism, Krzysztof Kieślowski’s “Dekalog” was one of the most immense undertakings the cinema had ever seen. There had been longer works, and more lavishly financed ones — even when accounting for inflation, “Dekalog” would qualify as a micro-budget project — but the existential girth of Kieślowski’s magnum opus immediately made it feel like a monolith among molehills.",ItsMahdiyarr
7.4,10,Dekalog (1988),"DEC 5, 2019","Touching and human, Dekalog is a trip inside morality and common people's dilemes. Doesn't matter social class, culture or context, it's hard not to indentificate yourself or at least feel dismayed or thinkfull and for that reason, series is timeless too.",Andremax
7.4,10,Dekalog (1988),"AUG 4, 2019","The greatest series of short films ever made, by one of the masters of cinema and almost certainly the greatest director of the 90s. An exploration into characters with intense moral and ethical dilemmas, that allows one to reflect on the intricacies and nuances of the human spirit. Dekalog is considered one of the most acclaimed and important works of art in recent history, yet I believe it deserves further adoration. This is extraordinary filmmaking, 10 of the best films you will ever watch.",BeastJ18
7.4,8,Dekalog (1988),"JUN 18, 2019","Commandments rehashed in city lights, they might hold up, might not but Dekalog's quality surely will test against time. Dekalog Krzystof Kieslowski; the co-writer and director, of this phenomenal ten part series, which is often claimed to be as ten hour long film, is a testament in itself, to filmmaking, storytelling and, art that drives all. With the crowd pleasing concept, the writers, Krzystof Kieslowski and Krzystof Piesiewicz, are actually enjoying. That's quite a shock, isn't it? The concepts are established, the theme well introduced, the cinematography almost like some painting, the metaphors spread across like elements and the characters staged with a spectacular choreography. What more is left, they wondered. And fun, is the answer they came up with. Take each of the chapters individually and you'll see for a brief period everyone is let loose in their own rhythm. The cars zooming, couple laughing, mother discovering her son or daughter, friends tearing up, brother spiralling plan and a boy dancing after getting an approval from her crush. What a release it is, speechless, to see such calculated tales feeling no obligation, breaking their rules, for that one smile of the day. Another fine quality and major theme of these films is the physical sequences. He wants you to scratch your brain, Kieslowski, when the physical acts are on the run. What is that urge that he gives birth to, that we feel compelled, almost insisting, on finishing that puzzle. No matter how carefree your attitude is, if someone is being chased or chasing, you would be mesmerized until they leave the frame. The spectators are too hovering around in these films, a particular one that can be seen in every chapter except for the last one, can often be considered as the perspective through which the germ of the idea that these creators had before magnifying these stories on screen. Now, as you can see, Dekalog is timeless not because of the hard work, but because of how much they loved working hard on it, they had fun as much as you had, I'd say that's a balanced world.",amheretojudge

7.4,10,Dekalog (1988),"APR 26, 2018","Krzysztof Kieslowski's ""The Decalogue"" is one of the most powerful cinematic experiences you'll ever have, and probably the best ensemble cast I've ever seen (if you consider them a single film, like I do). I used to think Mike Nichols, Ingmar Bergman and Robert Altman were the supreme actor's directors, but I might consider Kieslowski (1941-1996) my #1 for this project alone. It helps that all the actors are unknown to most of us and not famous Hollywood stars, and that makes the experience even more real, but that wouldn't be much if they couldn't act. I had seen Kieslowski's ""Three Colors"" (which happens to be my all-time favourite trilogy), but I didn't think of him as a particular actor's director because Juliette Binoche or Julie Delpy don't necessarily need a great director to deliver a great performance (I'm not sure about Irène Jacob, though; I haven't seen ""The Double Life of Veronique"", in which she's supposed to be brilliant, and I do like her in ""Red"", but she never impressed me in any movie not directed by Kieslowski). Adrianna Bierdzynska (who looks like a cross between Jennifer Jason Leigh and Hilary Swank) and Olaf Lubaszenko, from segments 4 and 6, respectively, stand out; they're more Oscar-worthy than 90% of the nominees of the past decade; but every member of the cast did a terrific job. Stanley Kubrick described ""The Decalogue"" as the only masterpiece he could name in his lifetime - if that doesn't make you curious to watch this poignant, unique experience, then you're not a film lover. 10 out of 10 in my books.",thelol

9.2,10,The Godfather,"JUN 24, 2025","The Mona Liza of Motion Pictures. Greetings from Lithuania. To call ""The Godfather"" a masterpiece or a classic would be underestimating. This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie many times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again. Rewatching it recently on 4K UHD disk kinda blew me away the fact of how incredible it looks. There isn't anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn't said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level. Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it's a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art. Overall, because you have probably already seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while. It contains everything that a cinema-goer can wish. The unforgettable and one of the kind motion picture, which probably like a great wine just keeps getting better with years.",badshaped

9.2,10,The Godfather,"SEP 25, 2024","The mafia epic to which all others are measured. Maybe even the greatest film of all time, but I don't think that's a fair judgment to cast. In either case, Francis Coppola's much-heralded masterwork, jumbo-sized but not without good reason, still delivers. The Godfather's sheer ambition is a sight to behold, packed with strong characters, complicated choices, bitter curves and a grand, decades-spanning arc. It's as close as cinema has ever come to matching the rich, chewy abundance **** novel, even if it does skim a few years in the third act. We're treated to layers upon layers of comprehensively-defined individuals, even the ancillary roles, with a strikingly complex dynasty at the center of it all. The Corleones are a crucially diverse group, distinct but also alike, and fundamentally familiar despite the off-putting nature of the family business. Sonny, the hot-headed heir apparent; Fredo, the kowtowed black sheep; Vito, the rational, well-composed patriarch; Michael, the intellectual firebrand with lofty ideals. In retrospect, their paths are obvious, but in the heat of the moment we're shocked by every twist of the knife. Moments of deep contemplation contrast with explosions of spontaneous violence, loud illustrations of the literal dog-eat-dog nature of this particular line of work. Coppola wrangles everything like the illustrated puppet master depicted in the franchise logo. It's all precisely orchestrated, timed for peak efficiency, yet somehow never grows formulaic or loses touch with its essentially human, organic pulse. Not a wasted movement, nor a missed opportunity. What an achievement, just to complete a film of this magnitude. That it was accomplished in just a year's time, first day of filming to opening day at the cinema, is absolutely baffling.",drqshadow

Y también quiero referirme a la escena que más resonó en mí, y es: ¿puede alguien considerar 'traición' si por esa acción puede ayudar a los demás? Creo que la respuesta dependerá de la situación y las personas involucradas; en mi caso es no. Y justo por eso, la aventura que tiene nuestro protagonista con la mujer me dejó un mal sabor de boca, por ella claro, ya que realmente no fue sincera.

Lots of people do good-to-great-work, but special kudos to Claude Raines who sinks his teeth into a complex role and gives it the exact right edge of fun, danger, cynicism, and heart--he's the star among stars.

Humphrey Bogard and Ingrid Bergman lead the way in this wartime complex romance that dives right in and let's you experience every emotion in the backdrop of Rick's Cafe Americain and the streets of Casablanca. This movie is entertaining and funny, enthralling, and features many iconic lines that have lasted a lifetime in American cinema. It has the most special way of telling a story of humanity during war, integrity's importance, and love's ultimate sacrifice. This movie avoids common narrative tropes and creates its own path and climax, and it's just perfect.

I honestly don't care that it's an old film, I personally think that's not a convincing enough excuse for hating a film as wonderful as this , because you are seriously missing out, if you haven't seen it. The cinematography is just fantastic, with clever brooding camera-work. The music by Max Steiner is outstanding, from the sweeping haunting love theme As Time Goes By, to the excerpts of the french national anthem. The scene where everyone starts singing in the café was extraordinary and one of the many highlights of the film. The screenplay is unquestionably one of the finest in the history of cinema, right up there with Shawshank Redemption and All About Eve, containing great memorable lines such as ""seems as though Destiny is at hand"". The performances were superlative, Humphrey Bogart giving one of cinema's greatest lead performances as the ""cynical sentimentalist"" Rick Blain. Also superb are Ingrid Bergman who positively lights up the screen as Ilsa, the young woman who breaks his heart, Paul Henreid as the fugitive husband, and Claude Rains as Captain Renault. The plot is a little complicated, but I couldn't help being impressed with the performances and the screenplay. Not to mention a timeless love story that I don't think has ever been topped. Overall, a masterpiece, that quite rightly received an academy award for best picture. 10/10 Bethany Cox",kyle20ellis

There are a ton of characters, and yet somehow, every one of them, with the exception of the ****, won me over. This movie is super heavy on dialog, but unlike modern cinema where characters talk just to fill time, the dialog in “Casablanca” feels like it is all in support of the plot, which forces you to hang on every word or else you will get lost.

8.7,8,Casablanca,"MAY 19, 2019","Bogart and Bergman are changing history, witness it now or a century later, something so pure as such, doesn't get rusty. Casablanca Curtiz is light on his feet and smooth as the Jazz that is continuously and melodiously played in the hotel. And I think it is his supervision that blends in sacrifice in romance, so pure and irreplaceable, that drama is overshadowed by its crowd pleasing concept. The director, Michael Curtiz installs tiny notions in the script that carves a momentum of live hotel and the do's and don'ts of a hotelier especially the magnetic reputation he or she juggles by dipping his or her hands on both the side of the dirt. The Robin Hood figure, is their way in, and with Humphrey Bogart playing one of the most iconic character, the first act of the film is building up his figure that is latter to be **** with such fragility. But the final act is brimmed with charm, so where they actually had to work was the introduction. And choreographed like some exotic dance, the entire hotel that is mapped out in front of us, makes us feel like home something that has aged well over the years. Personally, I prefer the sacrifice of his hotel's fairness regarding the gambling policies. To me, that would always be the game changer, not only the actress's performance but the tone that shifts with such calculative baby steps that you are sinking in deliberately in those twinkling eyes. And if Bogart is boasting off with some of his best work then Ingrid Bergman definitely casts the magic powerful enough to rubble him down in a blink. Their equation is like some wine, you are buzzed with the aftermath soberness rather than their poetic romantic vacation. Casablanca defines the Hollywood version of Americana set in a different location, it was ahead of its time then and it is now; all hail the classic dish serving one purpose and one only.",amheretojudge

It is understandably difficult to have an overarching theme when trying portray the life and struggles of an adolescent boy. That is perhaps why this particular film seemed to wander significantly.

Cinematography is pedestrian. The screenplay is pedestrian. The story of growing up presented here itself is not very compelling. Sorry to say but the child actors here really were very bad at acting (not that that could have been foreseen when they started). The only really neat or special part of this movie is watching the children age as the film progresses, which does not by itself make it deserving of a perfect score for film-making all time.

It results in a very effective and enriching film experience as if following the life Mason rather than the highlights of Mason. Being the same age as this kid it truly resonated with me at a level I cannot describe, and needed some time after viewing the experience to reflect and ponder myself. Because that's what the movie strives for. Moments of reflection, perspective and seeking truth on the journey of life, but never giving us the answers.

8.7,9,Rear Window,"AUG 27, 2025","It's incredibly challenging to write a review of this film - so many ideas and layers of cinematic storytelling are embedded within it, and so many dissertations and essays have been written about it, that the very notion of capturing it all in a review feels excessively grandiose and overwhelming. Rear Window is such a comprehensive film in terms of cinematic language and richness of detail that any review will inevitably be incomplete and oversimplified. The film begins with the raising of the curtain - the opening of the window shades in Jeff's apartment, a perspective that becomes both Jeff's and the viewer's throughout the film. The soundscape consists of conversations, street noises, and occasional music played by a neighboring composer on his piano or a record player. The viewer is fully immersed, becoming Jeff, spying on the neighbors alongside him while also observing Jeff himself. Swelteringly bored, he watches his neighbors, each becoming a character in a silent film narrated by Jeff. The audience see them through Jeff's eyes and form impressions based on his commentary. Stella accuses Jeff of voyeurism for watching his neighbors. But isn't the viewer doing the same, observing both the neighbors and Jeff? Moreover, how reliable is Jeff as a narrator of what he sees? Is everything on screen a fiction conjured by Jeff's imagination, or perhaps a dream? Just as the film itself is a fiction crafted by Hitchcock's imagination. And how accessible is reality to our perception before it becomes part of our imagination? Jeff isn't eager to abandon his bachelor habits and marry Lisa, despite her captivating beauty and charm. Lisa is as alluring as Miss Torso, a dancer whose lingerie-clad exercises Jeff spies on. With Lisa, one could indulge in the passions of the newlyweds behind another, heavily curtained window. It's tempting to dedicate a song like ""Lisa,"" composed by the neighbor across the way, to her. But there's another side to marriage - another movie, or rather, another neighbor's apartment, tells a different story. There, Lars Thorwald, a traveling salesman once as free as Jeff, endures his wife's torment, as she lounges in bed all day in a negligee suspiciously similar to the one Lisa will soon wear while parading before Jeff. Yet abandoning Lisa feels inhumane - on the ground floor lives the Miss Lonelyhearts, imagining companionship and, in one scene, wearing a green dress the same shade as Lisa's. Central to these competing narratives is the story of Lars Thorwald and his wife. Jeff suspects Thorwald, fed up with her endless taunts, has murdered her - much like Jeff might wish to be rid of Lisa, whose talent, he claims, is creating trouble. Jeff's detective friend dismisses his suspicions, insisting it's just his imagination. Masterfully manipulating angles, Hitchcock shifts the camera's perspective to the detective's point of view, making him the primary narrator and disorienting the **** film's intrigue seems to hinge on whether Lars Thorwald killed his wife. But perhaps it's really about whether Jeff will marry Lisa? Everything happening across the courtyard strikingly mirrors what's happening in Jeff's apartment - or rather, in his mind. What he observes through the rear window, or in his imagination, becomes more real than what's in his room. Who in their right mind would watch Miss Torso or Miss Lonelyhearts when the stunning Grace Kelly is in the room? Yet Lisa, even in a negligee, must close all the curtains to become Jeff's focus. She jokingly says she'd only distract him from Miss Torso by moving across the courtyard and performing an hourly striptease. Indeed, Lisa truly captures Jeff's attention and becomes part of his reality only when she becomes part of his fantasy - leaving the apartment and entering Thorwald's, transforming into the daring heroine of the thriller Jeff and the audience are watching. Only then does she earn the ring on her finger, won through bravery and adventure. How much of Jeff's narrative about what's on screen reflects reality? Are we watching a murder investigation or Jeff's nightmare about marrying Lisa? How real is reality to us until it becomes part of our imagination? Studies from the early 1950s in the U. S. showed most Americans dreamed in black and white, but by the 1960s, most dreamed in color. This shift coincided with cinema transitioning from predominantly black-and-white to color. If dreams reflect our unconscious, how much does cinema's influence on dreams distort our unconscious, and how much does the latter reflect our direct experience rather than what we've seen on screens? Would Jeff have seen the real Lisa if he hadn't viewed her through his camera lens as the heroine of his thriller fantasy? C. S. Lewis wrote that imaginary beings have their insides on the outside - they are visible souls - and that a man can only be truly seen by placing him in the imagination and viewing him as a fairy-tale character.",Icivindur

8.7,8,Rear Window,"SEP 25, 2024","Hitchcock binds James Stewart to a wheelchair, deposits him at the picture window of a big city apartment and lets an idle imagination find its own drama. In this case, it's a murder most foul behind the drawn curtains of a neighboring unit. Costar Grace Kelly is refined and magnetic as the fashion conscious would-be fiancée; a model of smooth-talking elegance who, after initial doubts, is soon drawn into the intrigue of what's actually happened in that dark room across the way. After an argumentative start, Stewart and Kelly quickly settle in as a close-knit pair of obsessed observers, stoking each other's suspicions and inducing a steady shared vigil. The issue of their troubled romance is problematic, introduced in the first act and never truly resolved, but that doesn't bother me. I much prefer them as whispering cohorts with a gossipy secret, and the film already has more than enough subplots going on. Rear Window is a steaming pressure cooker of a suspense story, one which encourages viewers to second-guess their impressions and then punishes them for doing so. Like a large-scale stage production, the entire tale is told against a single backdrop: an unusually busy, uninhibited residential block. Sir Alfred's aptitude for frugal filmmaking is on full display here, utilizing every inch of screen to fill blanks and enrich the environment. It hustles, it bustles, it stirs in the morning and settles down after dark. We get to know each resident, to learn their habits and patterns, just like Stewart does from his lonely perch. Perhaps a little slow and meandering to start, once the pieces come together and our well-meaning voyeurs take matters into their own hands, it accelerates like a spooked getaway driver.",drqshadow

Some with importance as Lars Thorwald (played by Raymond Burr), some way less, as the sculptor on the ground floor. It is really pleasant to see all these protagonists evolve around each others for two **** the scenario remains interesting, I must say that the turns of events are not that much. There are some scenes deprived of ingenuity, overly long or simply contributing to make the plot falsely more complex.However I enjoy how the films goes from morality to psychology with the triad LB - Lisa - Stella, each giving his opinion about what is going on and how.",clem666

Hitchcock is stunning at creating sublime story's that simmer and build into thrilling crescendos and rear window is his best example of that with his idiosyncratic camerawork swoops like the voyeur the main character is. Grace Kelly is an engrossing independent brave socialite reporter and Stewart a cynical photographer but Ritter stands out as the sharp wit nurse. The script is exceptionally well written .

It has tension, suspense, humour, has a strong voyeuristic tone to it and moves along at a good pace. The cinematography was truly excellent, dark in some scenes and beautiful in another. The script is fantastic and genuinely memorable(Thelma Ritter's wisecracks especially), likewise with the story, about a man who is convinced that his neighbour has killed his wife. I have always considered Rear Window's main merit to be the performance of James Stewart, he was perfect as Jeff, the man who is in a wheelchair, due to a broken leg. The other performances go without fault either, especially from the beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa and Raymond Burr in a chilling performance as ""the villain of the piece,"" Mr Thorwold. The music was expressive and atmospheric courtesy of Franz Waxman, and the climax was possibly the highlight of the film, after Stewart's performance. The 1954 version of Rear Window will always be a classic, not the inferior TV remake with Christopher Reeve. All in all, a must see for those who are fans of Hitchcock. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",kyle20ellis

Hearing him query other peoples interpretations of what he saw made me doubt the truth behind the circumstances. Its definitely a strong case of armchair detective, of course (how could it not?). It features a strong performance from both James Stewart and Grace Kelly, who is quick to challenge his assumptions. It makes me wonder what do others read in to otherwise seemingly every day activities and observations?. Its a slow builder, plot wise but it does well at pulling the audience in, questioning things.

I was mesmerized by the photography in particular, which constantly discovers new ways to portray what could have been a rather redundant, flat, boring landscape. Truly beautiful, almost ruminative at times, with an appreciation for the artisanship of film. As for the plot, well... it's a bit slow. Particularly so in the nearly four-hour director's cut, which feels completely unnecessary. I've never seen the theatrical release, which is noted for being incomprehensible in places due to the awkward cuts, but it seems suspicious that half an hour or more couldn't have been lopped off somewhere to improve the pace. Lawrence of Arabia is an exhausting watch, and not just because of the draining personal transformation we see in the title character. There's good material, of course, plenty of it. The hopeless inner squabble of an Arab population that's desperately close to the unified independence they seek. The protagonist's progression from philosophical humanist to enraged berzerker to **** shell. We get plenty to think about, long after the credits have finally, mercifully rolled, but it's a marathon to reach that point. A Best Picture winner that's technically marvelous, thematically challenging and open-minded, but the ending left me feeling cold and there's really no excuse for it to run for as long as it does.",drqshadow

The film that inspired Steven Spielberg to pursue a career as a film maker for good reason - 'Lawrence of Arabia' is a cinematic treasure - the greatest ""Epic"" movie, and one of the 5 greatest films ever made. The spectacularly gorgeous and awe inspiring cinematography of Freddie Young tips the scale for me in favor of 'Lawrence Of Arabia' as Film's greatest work of art in the Epic genre, and surpasses 'Citizen Kane', and The 'Shawshank Redemption’, landing at #3 on my lMDb ""Top 5 Greatest Films"" ever made list, topped only by 'The Godfather' (#1) and 'Spotlight' (which moved up to #2 all-time in its first year of eligibility in 2020). The immensity and scale of the desert creates the perfect canvas on which Lean paints his masterpiece - We shall never again see authentic location shoots on this truly epic scale, as granted permission for such is virtually impossible today (one reason why films are shot in similar locals around the world, but often not the actually location where the story takes place). Restoration efforts in 1988 led by Spielberg and Scorsese saved most of what would have been a tragic loss. Now available in 4K UHD, the film has never looked better. My grandmother took me to see 'Lawrence Of Arabia' at a beautifully restored baroque theatre when I was 12, as the film was periodically shown in such art film houses for years after its release - It is an event I will never forget.",Instant_Palmer
8.5,10,Lawrence of Arabia (re-release),"MAR 1, 2021","My score 100/100 Sweeping, epic and literate version of British adventurer and soldier T E Lawrence's experiences in Arabia during the First World War. Lawrence, miraculously well played by Peter O'Toole, ""went native"" when sent into the desert to find Alec Guinness's Prince Feisal. Before long he was striking out himself against the Turkish Ottoman Empire, which still held sway in the region at the beginning of the last century. Lawrence's efforts to unify the various Arab factions are particularly prescient. Lawrence became an inspirational warlord whose neutral presence amongst the Arab tribes, lead by Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn, amongst others, served to glue together shifting and uneasy alliances. As well as wrestling with himself, with his own demons, and with the cruel desert environment, the Englishman was also faced with culture clashes which pitted not only the imperialists against the indigenous populations, but also the mercenary practices of the Arab guerillas against the discipline of the British army. In the end, Lawrence himself does not know which side he is on, nor which party he belongs to. Set against a backdrop of the Arabian desert, the nomadic allies under Lawrence's direction, attack and disrupt the Turks' efforts to maintain control of the territory, whilst the elephant - the British army and its heavy guns under General Jack Hawkins - pushes ever deeper into the area: not until his job is done does Lawrence learn that the French and British governments have carved up the middle-east between them and that the battle-lines for the 21st century are already being drawn. Scripted by the inimitable Robert Bolt and directed by David Lean, Lawrence of Arabia is one of those films without a weakness, despite drawing complaints for its near four hour length. The dialogue, cinematography, soundtrack and especially direction are superlative; likewise the supporting actors. But it is O'Toole at his charismatic best who steals the show in his starring debut; he never looked back. It may take an effort to watch this movie, but is well worth the ride and will, by the bye, provide some insight into the fractious and volatile world of Arab politics. One of the best films ever made.",caleburbina2001

8.5,9,Lawrence of Arabia (re-release),"FEB 21, 2019","000First and foremost, this movie has way more humor than I ever thought it would have. From its very beginning, I was quite surprised by the amount of humor I found, not only because I didn't expect so, but also because it often works pretty well! Another great surprise I had watching this movie is that I didn't find it boring at all despite its nearly four-hours runtime. A long runtime alone doesn't make a movie bad or weak, but it certainly doesn't help. But I really think there is almost no second that David Lean has wasted in this textbook example of epic cinema. It's quite entertaining for plenty of reasons; two of them are the fascinating cinematography that treated my eyes with some of the most jaw-dropping images I've ever seen been captured on film, and the mind-bogglingly masterful editing that is easily also one of the best I've ever seen in film. Lawrence of Arabia is also surprisingly very simple despite its fiendishly complex portrait of the titular character. Actually it may be sometimes too simple for its own good, for I think the movie became superficial and shallow at the beginning of its second half for the sake of nothing but developing the character of Lawrence. There are some key events that should have been more focused on, but ended up being demonstrated comparatively quite fast and superficially. That made the second half a bit muddled, unlike the unbelievably perfect first half, but this wasn't much of an issue for me; because David Lean really make up for this simplicity by delivering a disturbing, terrifying, opulent, astute and utterly unique psychological profile of a heroic, yet flawed historical figure that is the protagonist, Lawrence. As for Peter O'Toole's performance, the only thing I could say is that I was quite mad for about the first half of the movie because how inaccurately serious-looking he appeared on the poster of the movie despite the fact he was rather good-natured, and looked quite charming. Of course, I realized that I was embarrassingly wrong when O'Toole gradually changed 100 percent to a very serious, and even seemingly mad man who struggles to find a balance in his life,nay, to discover his identity. I also want to say that I'm so so proud of Omar Sharif, who brought one of the most iconic secondary characters in the history of cinema! Alec Guinness was also terrific as Prince Faisal, although I still think he delivered his best performance in The Bridge on the River Kwai, another epic from Lean. Auda Abu Tayi is one of the most blatantly greedy characters I've seen in film, and it could have never been portrayed so convincingly by other than the great actor, Anthony Quinn. If there is only one film deserves to be described as Epic, it's Lawrence of Arabia! (9/10)",ahmedaiman1999

8.5,10,Lawrence of Arabia (re-release),"MAR 18, 2018","This film tells an important part of T. E. Lawrence's life. A curious and highly intelligent man, joined the British Army during First World War and had a decisive role in the Arab Revolt of 1916 against the Turks. Directed by David Lean and scripted by Robert Bolt, it has the participation of Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif. T. E. Lawrence is one of the most interesting characters of the First World War. It wasn't a brilliant general or military, but got a huge part along the Arab tribes, disunited and often rivals, making them a highly effective troop (despite being composed of irregular militias). The film shows us how he got it and the price he paid (the scenes of violence when he was imprisoned by the Turks, although softened, can still suggest the alleged anal **** that he have suffered, among other tortures). The film is full of stunning scenes of the desert and is visually appealing, perhaps one of the epic films that gave greater attention to the use of natural landscapes to impress the public. The harshness of living conditions (or rather, survival) of the local tribes is also depicted with objectivity, as well as the importance given to water and control of wells. The action scenes were well thought out and show how the struggle was unequal, apparently doomed to failure (the Arabs battled with archaic methods and weapons, when compared to those used by Turks). The performance of the actors is something exceptional. The film is full of great players who have been at their best. Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif stand out naturally by the exceptional quality of their work, in a film that has become largely responsible for their consecration. The costumes are also excellent and, at least to me, seem consistent with the kind of clothes and uniforms depicted in photographs of the time, a sign **** historical consulting work. The same can be said of military equipment shown. The soundtrack, an essential part **** epic, is one of the best that has been done by Hollywood, having the signature of Maurice Jarre.",FilipeNeto

I watched this because it was voted top Adventure movie in many places, but I would not call this an adventure, more a biography as stated before. There is no structure to make this an interesting and exciting story, just a historical retelling with only its events as pacing, making it slow and unsuspenseful. It certainly didn't need the extra hour and a half it took, but lacking any structure they decided to show everything they had and cut nothing.

8.5,10,Lawrence of Arabia (re-release),"OCT 22, 2015","Lawrence of Arabia is a classicist Epic directed by David Lean, and starring Peter O’Toole as the titular character T.E. Lawrence. In many ways Lawrence of Arabia exemplifies an Epic, but what may be most impressive about the film is it’s use of character development and themes. Lawrence of Arabia may be the best epic of all time, because it is grand in scope, long but never boring, and beautiful to look at. It truly is a masterpiece. When one thinks of what defines an epic, they could point to Lawrence of Arabia as a perfect example, it literally sets the standard. For example Lawrence of Arabia contains many Extreme Wide Shots of a vast panoramic landscape, this is one of the most recognizable elements of a epic, reinforcing how large in scope the story is. Most epics deal with stories that have a sense of spectacle, and therefore use these huge landscapes to show that, Lawrence of Arabia does that as well as any other film. Set against the Arabic dessert, which lends itself to large panoramic landscape shots, the audience is treated to seeing a beautiful picture, and in the middle we see these characters trying to navigate their way through it all. The film liked to use mostly wide shots, so much so that when they use a close up, it truly feels like it has meaning. On top of that Lawrence of Arabia contains some of the most luxurious set designs, and costumes of the time. High production values is of course is another common element of an epic, but the most impressive thing about Lawrence of Arabia is the pacing and the character development. At almost four hours it’s hard to imagine a film that wouldn’t feel long, but somehow Lawrence of Arabia manages not to. This is most likely because the themes and characters are both relatable, but also larger than life in some ways. Seeing a normal man navigate his way through massive desserts, and through foreign cultures may make him seem larger than life, but to his core the film keeps Lawrence human, so the audience never feels detached from him. The film deals with age old themes such as the “fish out of water” theme, which is used quite often, but arguably never better than in this film. As with most of the best films, the story and character development is mostly visual. In the beginning we quickly see how out of place Lawrence is, as we see his Arab escort shot for stealing water, Lawrence is outraged, as to him killing is taboo, and water is a common commodity, yet to the arab culture, Water is so precious it’s worth killing for. As the film goes on Lawrence learns the cultural difference, and learns not to treat other cultures as barbaric, because to them he is the barbarian. Utilizing beautiful grandeur Lawrence of Arabia still stands as one of, the best epics of all time, and a true masterpiece of cinema. Embodying all of the characteristics of a classic epic film Lawrence of Arabia is truly impressive because of it’s masterful pacing and character development. It truly is an epic experience.",tjman09
8.5,10,Lawrence of Arabia (re-release),"JUL 26, 2015","Whenever the word ""desert"" comes to mind, most people think of it as, hot, boring, sandy. All terms that are true in the desert and is one place you never want to be. ""Lawrence of Arabia"" proves to be a historical masterpiece in cinema, that won seven oscars including best motion picture of 1962. History is a big part of ""Lawrence of Arabia"", as it follows the controversial leader known as T.E Lawrence (played by Peter O'Toole). The film is very much accurate following the Brits and Arabs fighting against the Turks in the early 20th century. Very well portrayed and executed, the film has everything you would expect from a historical movie, being entertaining to watch every minute. The film starts out with one of the most beautiful musical scores ever composed. We are introduced to the movie hearing an original musical score for six minutes until the movie fully begins. The score is epic, funny, and enjoyable as you wait for the movie to begin. We then see a man riding on a motorcycle, he is not in the desert, but in England. The scene then transitions to a historical sight in another part of England remembering the battle of Arabia. T.E Lawrence sets out to find the prince (played by Alec Guinness) to help him fight the Turks during the World War I era in the early 20th century. He is set out by the Brits to go and find him, many new characters are introduced along the way, such as Sharif Ali (played by Omar Sharif), and Auda Abu (played by Anthony Quinn). The best thing about the characters, they all have something to do with the plot, not just to be thrown in there to be extras. The setting is like no other, taken place in the Arabian desert, the setting makes the adaptation of the film unique. The award winning cinematography made the film as great as it is and beautiful to look at. The costumes fit with the story of the film as all the Arabs look like the way they the used to look like. Overall, ""Lawremce of Arabia"" is a classic masterpiece. The film truly deserved the best picture award, and without a doubt, this is my favorite movie of all time. There is no other film I have seen that could top this one. Simply memorable by all the performances and classic scenes, this one os worth a go.",30Cents
8.5,10,Lawrence of Arabia (re-release),"APR 29, 2015","The historical epic has been a staple of the motion picture industry since the silent era. Over the years, it has evolved to mesh with the times and meet audiences' expectations. Viewers in the 1910s got D.W. Griffith's racist Birth of a Nation, while movie-goers in the 2000s were poleaxed by the trite but visually impressive Pearl Harbor. In between lie the best of the epics, and, while it's impossible to single out one as being at the inarguable top of the heap, David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia is certainly a contender for the position. Riveting from beginning to end, featuring stellar performances, amazing cinematography, and a story without a trace of fat, the film does everything an epic is supposed to do - and more. Lawrence of Arabia recounts the larger-than-life exploits of T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), an officer in the British army serving in the Middle East during World War I, who, according to one observer, ""was a poet, a scholar, and a mighty warrior. He was also the most shameless exhibitionist since Barnum & Bailey."" The film opens in 1935, with a prologue that shows Lawrence's death as a result of a motorcycle accident, followed by his funeral. The time frame then shifts back more than 20 years to Cairo, where Lawrence is about to begin the greatest adventure of his career. His commanding officer orders him to enter the desert and make contact with the Bedouin Prince Feisel (Alec Guiness), who is a British ally in the fight against the Turks. What follows is not only an account of how Lawrence became a pivotal figure in the Arab revolt against the Turks, but of the nearly-Shakespearean rise and fall of his character. The director's cut runs a little over 3 1/2 hours, and every moment seems necessary. The pacing is tight - there's plenty of action and adventure interspersed with character development, plot exposition, and majestic visuals. Therefore, it's hard to believe that a theatrical version exists in which more than 30 minutes of material was excised. Indeed, most people who saw this film during the 1960s and 1970s weren't getting the entire picture (although Lean was involved in the trimming done to create the 3 1/4 hour print widely seen in U.S. theaters and the 3-hour version shown on television). Fortunately, in the late-80s, the original edition of Lawrence of Arabia was painstakingly restored (with the participation of David Lean and the surviving actors). The restoration was handled so expertly that, watching the new print, it's virtually impossible to see the shifts in visual acuity that often mark the inclusion of previously-eliminated scenes. The most compelling aspect of Lawrence of Arabia is the way in which it dissects the fluid, often-contradictory personality of the title character. Like many of the best classic ""war"" movies (such as Patton), this one uses the battles as a backdrop for a character study. The combat sequences in Lawrence of Arabia are perfunctory, with few of the details shown. This allows us to focus on the individual at the epicenter of the storm. When we first meet him, Lawrence is an oddball craving a mission in the desert (calling it ""fun""), something that his fellows shun. After spending some time with the Arabs and being asked why he likes the desert, he has a simple answer: ""It's clean"". The movie explores Lawrence's friendship with Sherif Ali, and shows how the Arabs willingly adopt him as their leader, even though he has white skin. But Lawrence's psyche suffers a severe blow after his torture at the hands of the Turks. Initially, he is unwilling to return to the desert, but, when commanded to do so, he comes back driven by a newfound lust for killing and a desire for revenge. His final mission - the capture of Damascus - shows Lawrence's dark side. There is one visual oddity associated with the manner in which Lawrence of Arabia was filmed. Because it was not possible to shoot the night scenes at night, they were lensed during the day using light-damping filters. So, while it looks like night, the camels and horses cast noticeable shadows. Today, computers would be used to digitally erase these anomalies (then again, today, the filming could be done after dark), but their existence in Lawrence of Arabia adds a certain otherworldliness to those scenes in which the ""night-shadows"" appear. For David Lean, widely regarded as one of the masters of epic filmmaking, Lawrence of Arabia represented the most ambitious undertaking of a fruitful career. Restored to its full length in 1989, the version available today shows the story as Lean intended it to be seen - provided the viewer is able to see it projected, not compressed onto a TV screen. While it's true that Lawrence of Arabia still works on the small screen, it is robbed of one of the most important aspect of any motion picture spectacle - the awe factor. When that is present, this becomes an event - something that even the most restless viewer will become lost in.",CineFiles

8.5,10,Lawrence of Arabia (re-release),"JUN 7, 2013","Whether it is the stunning visual landscape that enthrals the entire film, the literary genius of the writing or the larger than life and superior acting of the cast involved, Lawrence of Arabia can stand among the rest as one of the greatest films, art or whatever else, to ever be created. Peter O'Toole puts in not only the finest performance of his career to date, but one of the finest and emotionally driven of any performance seen in cinema, portraying T.E. Lawrence in his debut is no menial task, but captured through his calm and collective speech, his arrogance for command and his undying will to succeed where most believed impossible is achieved impeccably on numerous occasions from O'Toole. Lawrence, a British Army Lieutenant and very much out of place in his position, is assigned to assess the intentions of Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) in his struggle against the Turks. Upon eventually meeting the Prince, Lawrence's constant interruptions of his General intrigues the Prince, who then lets Lawrence carry out his own mission of a sneak attack on Aqaba, a Turk-fortified city. As Lawrence earns the respect amongst his combatants, he soon finds himself as a sort of God amongst men, they would kill for him and also die for him. The score from start to finish immediately solidifies what this film is doing, creating and building an epic story, character driven and thoughtful masterpiece to cement a legacy not only for the man it follows, but for its own reputation as a film, and a film it is. A more beautiful and stunning film is rare to see without countless special effects, yet Lawrence of Arabia uses something that is seen as nothing, the desert, and completely obliterates any of the concerned. When films like this are viewed on an imaginative and respected level, its difficult not feel very different than you were before watching them, much like Apocalypse Now and others, Lawrence of Arabia gives you something that you may not have ever witnessed before, and probably won't witness again, the effort of the film, the stunning visuals and the literary brilliance of the writing, especially for the wonderful Peter O'Toole, along with Omar Sharif, many moments of screen time are given to O'Toole, and with his piercing blue eyes its hard to look away for whatever reason. Take it from a fan, you will never see another film quite like this, best films lists or not, this is what a masterful film is all about, big and bold on every scale, never holding back its potential and delivering a powerhouse feature that lives on fifty years later, you owe it as a film fan to watch and be amazed.",StevenF

8.5,3,Lawrence of Arabia (re-release),"JUN 23, 2011","I watched this movie with no doubt that it would be as good as it was made out to be. It was in the top 10 of the AFI top 100 movies of all time, and it had received many 4 star reviews. About an hour into the film, I fell asleep. Now, fans of the film would say, ""Oh, you can't handle the impact of a long epic film. You have a short attention span."" Well, with me, that is not the case. But, on the subject of length, this film is almost four hours long. For the content displayed in this film, the running time was way too long. If Titanic can cram all the hefty things it needed in a matter of 3 hours, then this is no excuse. Nothing was happening. I mean, literally nothing. The screenplay needs a real doctor, because it has so much unneeded dialogue. It just procrastinated its way through, I think because it really had nothing more interesting. Director David lean is probably one of the best directors of all time, but in this film, you can tell that his and the producer's mind frame was ""I wonder how many academy awards I can get through this film?"" It wasn't made naturally, it was gargantuan for this point. I about turned off the movie when I saw a thirty second look at the desert landscape for about the millionth time. Yes, it does take place in the desert, but this movie was called ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" not ""The Arabian Desert."" Which brings me to my next point: Peter O' Toole. I have seen him in many marvelous performances. I'm surprised he hasn't received an Oscar yet. But, his interpretation of Lawrence was so vague. You only saw the exterior, you never saw the interior. He gets a rush out of killing, yet we don't know why. i partially blame it on the script writers, but I also partially blame it on him. When you are an actor, you have to convey to the audience who you are, no matter how good or bad the script is. he is playing the character that embodies the whole movie. It is solely about him, and he doesn't sell that. Now, I'm not going to bash everything just because I don't like the film, but i will compliment Alec Guinness for his outstanding but short performance as Prince Feisal, Maurice Jarre for the superb score, and the editing. Sorry to burst the bubble of the ""Lawrence of Arabia"" fans, but I really think this film is overrated, and that it is not as good as it is made out to be. That is my opinion on ""Lawrence of Arabia.""",Batman30512
8.3,10,Citizen Kane,"SEP 2, 2025","It’s tough to fairly critique a movie so widely lauded as one of the greats. How does one watch The Godfather with an open mind after fifty years of critical pressure? That goes double for Citizen Kane, given its additional age and notoriety. Older movies can be hard to contextualize, even for those already well-versed in the era’s cinematic language. In 1941, Hollywood had only been making talkies for a few years. For Kane, though, I actually see this elder status as a benefit: it does more than just hold up, it holds its own. Eight decades later, Orson Welles’s ambitious debut remains engaging and easy to watch, even by modern standards. There’s just something about a well-crafted story, told with care and conviction, that never goes out of style. Its plot is colorful and alluring, stuffed with dynamic, rounded characters. Its artistry is sharp and daring, richly designed and strikingly photographed. Each frame is deeply considered and imbued with meaning. There’s similar fire and passion in nearly every element. The big cast of stage veterans, eager to prove their worth on the screen. The iconography, expertly crafted and larger than life. The lingering mystery of “Rosebud,” befuddling and powerful as a story mover and rewarding as a final revelation. Welles has lined everything up just-so, an intricate web of large acts and small tells that come together to weave an irresistible saga. Citizen Kane’s framing device works extraordinarily well, dispensing a street-smart journalist to puzzle over a magnate’s last words while sifting through the spoken record to paint an outline of his life. He segues from one interview to another, capturing snippets of the man’s character from all angles, before finally arriving at the conclusion that no single word, no matter how enigmatic, could possibly explain a life so thoroughly lived. He’s completely wrong on that count. “Rosebud” speaks volumes about this man: his desperation to be admired and loved; his refusal to really open himself up in pursuit of those goals; his tireless efforts to meet an impossible expectation; his sharp dismissal of anyone who dares challenge his ideals. Unfortunately for our weary newsman, no living soul remains to express these nuances, nor to connect them to the word in question. Without that context, its origins mean nothing. Charles Foster Kane left plenty of observers in his wake - spurned comrades, embittered lovers, jaded employees, jealous observers - but the man they describe is only a projection. The image he wished the world to see, not the one which dwelt beneath the steely shell. That’s a relatively simple story, really. The man who seemingly has everything, overcompensating to satisfy an urge that most of us would take for granted. Welles adds cinematic flourishes, draws magnificent performances from his cast (including himself) and spices it with a tantalizing secret, but this wouldn’t be recognized as such a landmark achievement if that main arc weren’t so well-realized, recognizable and effective. Put it all together? Yeah, that’s deserving of all-timer status. A masterpiece of film.",drqshadow

Es innovador sin duda, pero yo creo que la historia no se siente cercana, y con esto me refiero a que, si bien la temática es interesante con respecto a la evolución del personaje principal, desde un niño hasta convertirse en la persona con más poder en el país hasta sus incontables fracasos que lo llevaron a, de cierta forma, aislarse del mundo exterior, y el final interesante que se refiere a esa búsqueda de muchos de nosotros por ser niños otra vez, que recordamos épocas anteriores en las que no pudimos vivir, se vuelve una búsqueda incesante de buscarla incluso hasta volverse tóxico. El problema es que esta parte pudo ser mucho mejor, dar más énfasis a esa etapa infantil para empatizar cuando ya se hiciera adulto, pero solo se muestran un par de escenas, lo que provoca que no exista una conexión tan grande con este personaje, pero por supuesto que es una buena película.",BigP4pa

8.3,2,Citizen Kane,"MAR 2, 2025","Extremely outdated - extremely overrated. I watched this film from beginning to end, including the extras, as I always do. So get right to the point, without any introductions. Does this film deserve a place in the list of ""250 audience ratings""/""Must See""? No. Does this film deserve a place in the pantheon of masterworks that have had a significant impact on cinema? Yes. I think it's stupid to give a film a high rating based only on how many innovative and significant ideas were used in it. The average viewer is primarily interested in the story and the quality of its implementation, rather than the ""play of light"" and ""shooting angle."" In my opinion, the objective weight of many ""enthusiastic"" reviews (10/10) is as low as the unfounded 1/1 (0/0) that are given to other films or games. It's time for aggregators and viewers to keep up with the times and change. All ""Tops"" need to be updated, not patronized, calling it a ""weighted system."" Perhaps the best solution would be to divide the tops by time-relevance or into purely viewer and professional ones. This isn't the first time IMDB/Metacritic/Rotten Tomatoes have disappointed me, but it's also not the first or last time they'll impress me. This case is rather an exception to the rule, i think. My actual rating is closer to 3.0, but alas, none of the aggregators support MORE accurate rating. A 2.0 for overrating. Although we understand perfectly well that this ""2.0"" will not be allowed.

Charlie Kanes tragic life begins when he's removed from his childhood home following his father's death to be trained to take on the Kane fortune, that removal from the only parents he knew too being surrounded by people who either work for him or are in awe of his heritage creates a very materialistic understanding of love that goes on to destroy almost all the relationships he values.

8.3,8,Citizen Kane,"DEC 29, 2021","I will write this review thanks to what I noticed for myself, as a casual movie watcher, inclined to grasp the few details that my knowledge allows me to grasp : Welles did an amazing job with the use of a certain type of cameras that I simply can't name as it permits us to catch the many informations given through the image. There are numerous impressive movements and details caught by the camera that lead us to draw particualr conclusions about both the characters and the scenes they are producing. The work of lights and shadows is highly interesting : this gave birth to gorgeous sequences and unavoidable effects on protagonists. Overall (and with a few exceptions), the actors' performances are terrific, especially Welles'. Backgrounds and environments are skillfully set up. It is like if I could see the colours of it behind their white-black-grey textures. Characters' last words are really meaningful and give the story more beauty. The story is interesting but I often had the impression that I didn't know where the film was going. We see the investigation going on and on and have no clue for what seems hours and hours. This contributes to give to 'Citizen Kane' the 'boring' side many people find in it. However I must admit that the narrative (helped by cross-fades and flashbacks used with mastery) is really surprising. Its length and the precipitation of the ending were two other features I would identify as 'flaws'. If the last manages to close the movie on a poetic side, I couldn't help but think 'all for this only ? Really ?' One last defect is that I found the film repeats itself a bit too much. Characters aswer many things we already know, and even the camera shows informations we already possessed. Eventually it is an interesting American 'success' story : don't hope to see and hear anything else than the so-called never-equaled beauty of the dreamland of the United States of America. I definitely should rewatch it but on first sight it deserves its title of best movie ever as long as we only consider the massive contributions 'Citizen Kane' had on modern cinema.",clem666

I basically enjoyed everyone else who came onscreen, the more memorable ones being Joseph Cotten (Jedediah) and Dorothy Comingore (Susan) - George Coulouris (Thatcher) has a few amusing moments, also. The editing and pacing are two other things that impressed me, as did the fantastic News on the March opening. This is one of those films that I've heard about for as long as I can remember, so I'm glad to finally get it watched - added to the fact it didn't disappoint.",r96sk

The film expresses that with showing an old couple visit their children, and you could think that it's not enough to base a film around but somehow Tokyo Story make it look so simple and deliver it so perfectly. That's one of the reasons that make this film so special. Another thing is how its made, the film is of course very old and the way of filming was sourly very different back then. The film is so casual and something other films don't tend to include or think about to include is well built-in in this film, and it's those little things which make it so special.

7.3,4,The Conformist,"SEP 29, 2024","In the age of fascist Italy, an ambitious young member of the secret police aims to leverage his lapsed relationship with a political dissident to curry favor and climb the ladder. Accompanied by his new bride, he travels abroad, does the recon, re-establishes contact and struggles to make the kind of decisive move his superiors are looking for. Participating in the assassination of an old acquaintance must have seemed so romantic and straightforward when it was just an abstract concept. Actually pulling the trigger once you've shared drinks together, after your wives have bonded over Parisian fashion, that's another matter entirely. Speaking in a purely technical sense, The Conformist is a marvel. Gorgeously framed and lit, with trend-setting photography and a crisp eye for detail, it's stylish, radiant cinema that emphasizes and enhances the chosen mood for each important scene. I found the script to be less inspired. Particularly so during the drawn-out second act, where our spy endlessly hems and haws about making a decision. Any decision, that is, not just the big, fat one at the center of all the swirling intrigue. For most of his life, he's survived in a detached state, merely going with the flow (nay, conforming) to avoid rocking the boat; this time such deferrals do him no good, yet he persists. History is littered with such men, following orders or standing mute while atrocities are carried out in their name, and while that's a valid point, it's tirelessly beaten and bandied about. The film isn't terribly subtle about any of its messages, operating with a proud moral superiority that I found stiff and redundant. It's so concerned with being IMPORTANT that it can often feel like a lecture. Good as a thought-stirrer, and outstanding as a visual specimen, but overwrought and wearying as a total package.",drqshadow

7.3,6,The Conformist,"DEC 20, 2017","Until I watched The Conformist my only experience of Italian filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci was 2003‘s The Dreamers starring Eva Green and Michael Pitt. Needless to say I found The Dreamers an easier watch, not least because the majority of that film is in English. The same cannot be said for The Conformist Bertolucci’s 1970 political drama. Spoken in Italian and French the film focuses on Marcello (Jean-Louis Trintignant) a young man starting a career in the Mussolini government. The film centers around Marcello’s mission to assassinate his former University Professor Quardri (Enzo Tarascio) who has fled to France. While this mission provides the essential plot, the film is essentially a character study of Marcello, the Conformist of the title. Through a number of flashbacks, Marcello’s childhood, marriage and his relationship with his parents are explored in detail. The flashbacks form the first half of the film and while they inform the events that follow the non-liner time frame along with the language barrier can be confusing at times. By exploring certain traumatic incidents in his childhood as well as the strained relationships with his morphine-addicted mother and his mentally ill father, we understand why Mercello is the way he is and why above all he strives to conform to the world around him, socially, politically and sexually. Mercello’s mission is further complicated by the presence of his new wife Giulia (Stefania Sandrelli) who believes that they are traveling to Paris for their honeymoon. The character of Giulia is deliberately irritating and when the Professors young wife (Dominique Sanda) is introduced she provides a huge contrast. The film then goes through a period of a becoming a love-quadrangle of sorts between Mercello, Quardri and their wives while the two men try to figure each other out. This in itself could have provided the basis for an entire film and in the wider context of the running time it feels a little rush. All the same everything that has gone before makes the climatic scene in the French mountains all the more powerful and we are now so deeply invested into Mercello’s character that he doesn’t need to speak. In a final dénouement the film flashes forward to the end of Mussolini’s dictatorship and we witness Mercello struggling to come to terms with his past. To reveal more than this would be a spoiler but lets just say the incident with the professor is not the only skeleton in Mercello’s closet. Your enjoyment of the film to some extent depends on your attitude towards subtitles. To me the only issue with subtitles is that it detracts from the performances, as your focusing on the text rather than the actor speaking. With repeat viewings this becomes less of an issue though and given its depth and complexity The Conformist definitely needs revisiting.",Domgwy
7.3,3,The Conformist,"MAY 30, 2016","Like some other reviewers, I was not impressed by the writing and the way the narrative was presented. It felt very disconnected, and sometimes confusing, with rough jumps between scenes, often making characterisation deficient. Perhaps it was a conscious decision aimed to convey Marcello's neurotic state and his need to belong, yet I felt that the camera-work alone did the job pretty well, especially the lighting (e.g. in the scene when we first see Guilia, in a striped dress, with moving light source patterned by the blinds, it reflects Marcello's mixed feelings about her), and the unorthodox angles. Also, I still wander if the narrative is objective, or maybe some of the scenes are Marcello's wishful thinking - while watching, I had a theory that the blue light indicated these, but it didn't quite hold up till the end. And, next to the ambiguous episodes, there are some annoyingly blatant parts. The metaphor of blind fascists was just too in-your-face. I wont give examples, look them up, there are quite some. The bit I liked about the plot was the suppressed homosexuality theme, under-stressed but sustained throughout the film with several moments of restrained homoeroticism, and the ending. I also liked the general air of the 30s, and the music - the credits song is currently stuck in my head. I'll quote a fellow reviewer here, who said something i fully agree with: ''A fine movie, but dry and difficult to relate to. I can't imagine many people calling this a favorite. I have a great deal of respect for its craftsmanship, above all, most notably because the filming is beyond gorgeous. '' Overall, while definitely a 9.5/10 for cinematography, The Conformist suffers from the need of a better and more coherent script. Which makes the movie sometimes very boring, confusing and frustrating. Maybe on a second viewing it might be better.",CalibMcBolts

7.3,8,The Conformist,"FEB 19, 2016","The Conformist can be quite slow, but it more than makes up for this with some serious production value. From the shot construction, framing, and lighting, the cinematography is pure perfection. The score is fantastic and really captures the feeling of the film very well. The production design and costume design are also both exemplary and capture the essence of the era. For the rest of the film, it does not rise to the level of these production values. However, due to its setting in Rome during and after the time of Mussolini's reign, it truly makes for a captivating background. The story as a whole as it unfolds is riveting and, though it can be tough to follow at times, really keeps you engrossed throughout. There are quite a few moving parts and it requires some historical knowledge of the era, but all that said, The Conformist is a phenomenal work from Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci. One of the most beautifully shot films around, The Conformist is a true piece of cinematic art.",Spangle
7.3,9,The Conformist,"NOV 7, 2013","Bertolucci is another wunderkind in the industry, at the age of 30, his fourth feature film, THE CONFORMIST has been proved to be a timeless classic, which I feel privileged to watch it now for the very first time. Tilting camera angle, impeccable shots paralleling the moving train and zooming in from the external side of the window, sensual hues, cubistic buildings, punctilious light and shade deployment (Professor Quadri, the hunchbacked man being introduced by his silhouette), fluid ballroom dancing sequences, the bleak and cold-hearted manslaughter in a wintry woodland, all emerge as consecutive surprises and gustos along its non-linear narrative. Marcello (Trintignant), a newly-recruited fascist member in Rome, is assigned for an assassination of his old professor Quadri (Tarascio), who dwells in Paris now with her young wife Anna (Sanda), the film hops back and forth episodically in recounting the newly-wed Marcello’s matrimony life with Giulia (Sandrelli), a petit bourgeois trophy wife; their honeymoon to Paris with a clandestine aim to carry out the task until Marcello compellingly falls for Anna; meanwhile Bertolucci allocates episodes to sort out Marcello’s personal lives, his attachment with his amicable blind friend Italo (Quaglio), his drug-addicted mother (Milly) and lunatic father (Addobbati); but underneath his placid and gentile veneer, lies an unfading quandary, stems from his encounter with a pedophile (Clémenti) in his childhood and his latent homosexuality which pulses him to a perpetual and professed seeking of normalcy. Trintignant is exceedingly under-appreciated in his sophisticated and self-constrained portrayal of a man put in contradiction with almost anything around him, perfectly tallies with the political message of the film, a stooge, put-upon in order to rectify his own weakness, indiscriminately clutches any straw to obey conformability, while in the end, a sense of loss and disparagement is his own bitter fruit. Sanda and Sandrelli are stunning in their own distinctive beauties, the former is resolute, swinging both ways and emanating the like-a-moth-to-a-flame fatalism; the latter imbues a more traditional feminine allure with little clue about what’s in her husband’s mind. Also it is noteworthy to give credit to Georges Delerue, who produced a spellbound score underlining the varying tenors of Marcello’s state of mind. THE CONFORMIST is a pièce de résistancer with its idiosyncratic aesthetic charisma to crown Bertolucci as the most important auteur in Italian cinema after his illustrious progenitors!",lasttimeisaw
7.3,7,The Conformist,"SEP 4, 2012","The rating this movie deserves would depend on what year it is. Back when this came out, it would have been relevant to Europe's still fresh scars from WW2. I'm in generation Y, and although this film makes a good historical and cultural demonstration, it is tailored for my parents, not me. It's something I have to ""try to get"", not something I can just watch and know immediately the points the movie is trying to convey. In other words, it's a movie I have to learn how to watch while I'm watching it, which was nice mental stimulation, but ultimately less entertaining and something my memory won't encode fondly, despite it's strengths. I hope this who know their 20th century European history and culture won't think I am being ungrateful, and I understand this movie should have higher appeal to those who do.
